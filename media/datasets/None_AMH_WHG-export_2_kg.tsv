Er hebben 2 forten gelegen, allebei Anthonio geheten. De eerste was van aarde en hout (bamboe)en had twee bastions ('Diemen' en 'Swaevelpunt') en een rondeel ('Burgt Maria'). Het was niet bestand tegen de moessonregens en de wallen stortten steeds in. Uiteindelijk is het toen in 1644 vervangen door het stenen redoubt dat er nu nog steeds staat (zij het nu zonder puntdak en met enige Engelse toevoegingen).

Following the First Javanese War of Succession (1677-1797) between sultan (soesoehoenan) Pakubuwono I and his uncle, Pangerang Puger, the Dutch gained control of the eastern half of Madura. In 1705 the Dutch recognized Puger, who took the title of Pakubuwono I, as lord of east Madura. In 1707 they signed a treaty in which the VOC got the right to build a fort in Bangkalan (Bancallan, Balangakallang) in West-Madura, the small wooden fort with two diagonal bastions stood opposite the royal palace. Cakrangingrat supported the Dutch during the Chinese-Mataram War (1740-1743). After the war there was a conflict with the company because Cakrangingrat demanded the two other regencies of Madura as reward for his support. He was captured and banished. His son was installed as prince- regent under the name Chakraningrat I in 1707. The wooden fort was replaced by a brick fort of 80 x 82,4 m with four half-bastions and a moat. On each bastion were four canons. The walls were 0.6 m thick and 4.5 m high. Inside the fort stood four buildings. The garrison of 25 soldiers and one European lieutenant also served as guard of honour of the sultan  In the 19th century the fort was classified as a defence work of the 4th rank against an indigenous enemy. In 1863 the garrison were removed and the fort disarmed. The civil government should keep the fort in such a good condition that it could be defended in case of war or rebellion. In 2008 the fort of Bangkalan housed the local police force.

In 1558 the Portuguese arrived at Labuha in the South Peninsula of Bacan Island, where they built a fort. Afterwards the Spaniards took over the fort. Around the fort lived circa 80 native people, who had become Christians. - In November 1609 a Dutch fleet under command of rear admiral Simon Jansz Hoen and ships with the Sultan of Ternate and his soldiers arrived before Labua. The attackers under command of Captain Louis Schot stormed the fort. All the people inside, man, woman and children, were massacred. - Hoen strengthened the fort by building four stone bastions filled with earth. On the <terre-plein> (courtyard) a strong square building with walls of one foot thick was erected. The lower floor was used as a storage for provisions, merchandise and gunpowder. The second floor was used as <corps de garde> (guard room) of the soldiers. The well inside the fort didn't yield enough water. Every day drinking-water had to be carried from the river to the fort. This was acceptable in time of peace but not during a siege. A small lodge outside the fort was used for the sale of merchandise. - In December 1609 the fleet left Bacian. Senior merchant Adriaan Dusses and 50 Europeans stayed behind in the fort, which was called Barneveld. In this period about 50 Europeans, including a merchant, an officer and a teacher, several slaves and a 25 Chinese, lived inside in the fort. - In 1627 a conspiracy of local people to raid the fort, kill everyone inside and hand the fort to the Spaniards was discovered. As a safety measure the members of the garrison afterwards no longer attended church in the village but held their religious serves inside the compound. - In 1696 the Dutch handed over Fort Barneveld to Sultan Alawaddien of Ternate. One sergeant and six soldiers stayed behind to keen an eye on the new owner. The next years the Sultan asked the Company several times to send a garrison or give him gunpowder and arms to defend the fort. It was not before 1733 that the VOC decided to quarter soldiers at Barneveld again, in order to prevent illegal trade. - Around 1860 the fort had a small garrison. In 1888 a fire caused much damage. The buildings were apparently repaired, as Victor Ido van de Wall, who visited Barneveld in the 1920s, wrote that fort was in a good condition. Today the fort is in ruins.

The Battery Batavia was one of the new defensive structures built hastily at the end of the eighteenth century to protect Banda from British invasion. The task of these batteries was to fire at approaching ships and prevent a landing ; they were not all-round defensible buildings like the larger forts. Batavia and the similar battery Sibergsburg were built on Gunung Api to cover the Lonthor strait between Lonthor and Gunung Api. Ultimately, these batteries did not much help the Dutch : when the British invaded in 1796, Banda quickly surrendered. In 1803, Banda was returned to the Dutch under the articles of the Treaty of Amiens. In 1810, when the conflict had resumed, the defenses once again quickly fell to the British. Even in 1803, when the British had handed Banda back to the Dutch in 1803, the batteries were already in disrepair, and the battery quickly turned into a ruin. At present, there are some remnants present, but the basic shape of the battery could not be identified.

In 1632 Governor General Hendrik Brouwer started construction of a wall with bastions, to protect Batavia against an attack. The wall made of coral stone replaced the earthen wall at the east side of the city (1623) and the redoubts which were built after the sieges of 1628 and 1629. The bastions not only protected against an attack from outside, but their location opposite of the main streets also made it possible to repress a rebellion inside the city. The fear of a rebellion was also the reason that there was not only a moat at the outside of the wall but also a moat at the side of the city. The caste protected the north east side of the city. A wall was built between the southeast bastion of the castle (Robijn) and the first bastion of the city wall (Amsterdam). The names of the bastions and main gates (Poort) at the east side of the city wall were: Amsterdam-Middelburg-Delft – Rotterdamse Poort gate (Pintu Antjol) - Rotterdam, Hoorn, Enkhuizen, Vianen – Gelderland - Catzenellenbogen - Oranje- Nieuwpoort (Pintu Besar) and Hollandia. The last bastion, Grimbergen, protected the bridge across the Kali Besar. When in 1640 the wall along the river between Hollandia and Grimbergen was finished, the defenses of the eastern part of the city were complete. The construction of the city wall at the west side of the city took more time. The moat was dug, but it was not before 1645 till the last part of the wall between the bastions Zeeland and Groningen was built. West of the river were the bastions Diest Poort (Pintu Kecil)- Nassau- Zeeland- Utrechtse Poort - (West-) Friesland - 0verijssel-Groningen- Zeeburg and Culemborg. The finishing touch was the floating beam which closed the river during the night. The castle stood at the other site of the river. The only attack on the city took place in October 1740. Chinese rebels stormed the Diest Poort but were repulsed by the soldiers on the wall. After the rebellion a hornwork was built before this bastion. In the 18th century several proposals were made to modernize the city wall, which was old-fashioned. These were never realized because they were too expensive. At the end of the 18th century the wall offered no more protection against an attack. The only function of the gates was to control the in- and outgoing traffic. In 1803 the doors of the gates were removed. The wall and gates were demolished between 1810 and 1815. Today only a part of the eastern wall between the (demolished) bastion Groningen and bastion Zeeburg and from there till bastion Culemborg still exists. The watch tower which was built inside bastion Culemborg around 1830 was not part of the defense works, but was built as an observation post for the weather and incoming ships. Both the bastion and the tower can still be visited. There are no remains of the eastern wall. The Oostzijdse Pakhuizen (Eastside Warehouses), which were built between 1748 and 1759 on the square before the castle , were once part of the defense wall between the castle and bastion Amsterdam.

The ships on the roadstead of Batavia and people in the city got their potable water from the Waterplaats (water basin) south of the city at the connection of the Molenvliet and the Ciliwong River. Here the water was not polluted, as it was further downstream in the city. In 1656, the Hoge Regering (Central Government of the VOC) ordered the construction of the redoubt Batenburg to protect the Waterplaats against raids by roaming soldiers from Bantam. After the construction of powder mills near the Molenvliet, the redoubt was used to store the gunpowder. A small military guard protected the site. In 1740 the soldiers beat off an attack of revolting unemployed Chinese land labourers and prevented that they could get the gunpowder. After the revolt the defences and the redoubt were updated and modernized. In 1757 a triangular fort was built to protect the water supply and powder house. It was named Grietenburg after Geertruida Maria Mossel, the daughter of Governor-general Jacob Mossel (1750-1761). The fort was demolished by Governor general Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1911). Today Pasar Glodok stands on the site of the fort. There are no visible remains of fort Batenburg.

Beekenburg protected both the bay itself with its various landing places and the narrow tongue of land between Caracas Bay and the Spaanse Water (Spanish Water), along which an enemy who had come ashore further eastwards could approach Willemstad. Partly as the result of a shortage of building materials, the original construction of Beekenburg appears to have taken quite a long time, but once completed, the fort proved to be virtually unassailable. It was not taken during the attack of the French corsair Cassard in 1713, and held out until after the capitulation during the British attacks in 1800 and 1807. Its design consisted of a massive tower with ten gun emplacements, with a lower bastion on the seaward side with another eight cannon.

On the small island of Nusa Laut stand the remains of a VOC blockhouse. In 1656 governor Arnold de Vlaming van Oudshoorn (1654-1656) named it after his home town Beverwijk. Twenty soldiers and a sergeant were posted here, who stood under the VOC command in Saparua. This blockhouse was not the first place the VOC had settled on the small island. Already under governor Herman van Speult (1618-1625) a small wooden house had been built on the south coast. For a long time local inhabitants did not resist the VOC presence. Therefore the defences were judged not to be very important and the blockhouse deteriorated. During the uprisings in 1817 however, the three soldiers stationed at fort Beverwijk were murdered and the post was shortly in control of local people. The Dutch quickly retook the post, but did not keep it up for a long time. Today the high walls of the blockhouse still stand and the form of the defence structures can still be recognised in the ruins.

Later the fort was repeatedly expanded. In the 18th century, the continual threat of war between the European naval powers led to further plans for the improvement of the defence of the island. Although a great many such drawings and plans survive, very few of them have actually been executed.

Fort Amsterdam is located on the north Coast of Ambon Island. Here, in 1600 Admiral Steven van der Hagen had overseen the construction of what is considered to have been the first Dutch fort in the Indonesian archipelago named the ´Kasteel van Verre´ (literally translated: Faraway Castle). The establishment of this first fort signalled the beginning of the Dutch take-over of the lucrative spice trade in the region, at the cost of the Portuguese. The remnants of Fort Amsterdam that can still be seen today are from later date. In 1633 VOC merchant Johan Ottens demolished the old trade post in Hila and ordered a stone redoubt encircled by wooden palisades to be built on this site. This construction was heavily damaged by an earthquake in 1644. As ordered by governor Arnold de Vlaming van Oudsthoorn in 1648 works starded repairing and extending the fort. He had the palisades replaced by quadrangular stone ramparts with two bastions and enlarged the redoubt. In 1674 fort Amsterdam was again hit by a strong earthquake, followed by a tsunami. Of the 40 people stationed on the fort 28 perished, while many more people living in the surrounding settlements lost their lives. After this event the fort was repaired. Seventeenth and eighteenth century drawings and engravings give an impression of what the three storey blockhouse would have looked like when it continued to function as a fortification to protect Dutch trade interests. During the Ambon revolt in 1817, Fort Amsterdam was attacked but not conquered. In 1863 it was abandoned by the military, but still the local authorities were instructed to maintain the building so it could be utilized again in the event of a rebellion. In 1869 the fort was officially removed from the list of fortifications. The structure became disused and had fallen in to ruin, until a restoration campaign was setup. The walls have been plastered and painted white, wooden elements have been replaced and the roof has been reconstructed. Since 1994 it has been open to visitors.

Located at the southern tip of Manhattan, it controlled access to the Hudson River and was a palpable symbol of the Company's rule over the colony. In April 1625, orders were given to engineer and surveyor Crijn Fredericxsz and others in charge to take up “the construction of the fort, which is to be called Amsterdam.” In 1626, some kind of fortification was apparently in place. The Amsterdam directors had specified the construction of a large five-pointed fortified settlement (a pentagon with a diameter of almost 300 metres), surrounded by an outer moat (ringhsloot) of eight metres wide. Within this area all colonists would have their lodgings, and it would encompass public buildings as well as a central market square of about 28 by 47 metres. These instructions were not fully executed as planned as the bedrock on the location of choice was too close to ground level for a deep ditch to be dug, and elevations made building a fortification of the suggested size an impossible task. It is likely that soon after 1626, director Minuit and his councillors decided to build a much smaller four-pointed fort, which was under construction by 1628 and probably more or less completed by 1635. Enslaved blacks, owned by the West India Company, carried out most of the work. Although the information from 1628 indicates the plan was to build the entire fort in stone, later documentation suggests that only one of the four points was completed that way. The rest of the fort consisted of wooden palisades and earthen bulwarks. As a result, the fort required constant repairs throughout its existence. By the late 1630s the fort was already in a bad state. The war with the Native Americans in the 1640s made clear to the West India Company that an upgrade of the fortifications was in order, but the costs were considered prohibitive by the WIC directors in the Netherlands. As a consequence much of the expenses and labour to keep the fort in a reasonable condition had to be supplied by the colonial government in New Netherland. This was not an easy task. The West India Company soldiers argued that construction work was not part of their brief and refused to undertake it, unless separate compensation was forthcoming. In all likelihood Company slaves carried out the bulk of the work, assisted by convicts sentenced to hard labour. The colonial government also attempted to raise funds from the local community. Within a few months of his arrival in New Amsterdam 1647, Director General Petrus Stuyvesant introduced a new excise on wine, brandy, and liquors. The income was intended to defray the costs of several public buildings, including the fort. In 1647, Stuyvesant planned to improve the fort, but nothing came of the plans. Meanwhile, the fort suffered from hogs, sheep, goats, horses, and cows, which the colonists allowed to roam free on the ramparts. In June 1650, director general and council tried to keep animals away by threatening to fine their owners. Yet the multiple repeats of this edict suggest that little heed was paid. When the First Anglo-Dutch War broke out, the directors quickly ordered their man in New Amsterdam to put Fort Amsterdam, Fort Orange, and Fort Casimir, in proper defensive states, so as to be able to defend themselves against attacks from the surrounding English colonies. Director general and council thereupon took various defensive measures, for instance “repairing and strengthening the fort, the old moat be dug up and fortified with gabions.” They also planned “to build some new inner lines of fortifications, so that one can be protected by the other and, if necessary, we can retreat from one to the other.” Whether all these plans were actually carried out is unclear, as soon afterwards, just when an English attack appeared imminent, news of peace in Europe arrived. By 1656, new repairs to the fort were considered necessary. At the repeated request of Stuyvesant and his council, the Amsterdam directors recruited three masons “to expedite the walling in of the fort” and sent them over to New Amsterdam. Soon after their arrival they began complaining that their salary of fourteen guilders a month was not sufficient. After their wages were raised, work progressed steadily. In July 1659, Stuyvesant reported to Amsterdam that if the masons kept up their work, one end of the fort would be ready next summer. The next task would be to make carriages for the guns. Stuyvesant informed the directors that these could be made in the colony, except for the iron parts, which had to be imported from the Dutch Republic. The building works appear to have been completed in 1661. Despite the efforts of Stuyvesant, Fort Amsterdam was in a bad state when the English arrived in 1664. After taking over New Netherland in that year, they changed the name of Fort Amsterdam into Fort James, after the Duke of York. It was eventually demolished in the summer of 1790. The debris was used as landfill. Today, the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom house stands on the location.

De redoubt stood on a little island at the confluence of the Bacharachtsgracht and kali Angke and was accessible by a little bridge. There was a garrison of 25 men. - In 1679 the fort was enlarged by the construction of a wall with four bastions. The existing redoubt was recorded within the new ramparts. Inside the fort stood several buildings including the house of the commander and a guardhouse. - The fort was demolished by order of Governor General Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811) in 1809. Today, there are no visible remains of it. The site of the demolished fort can easily be found on the peninsula between Kali Angke and Angke Saluran.

Upon completion of fort Nassau at Banda Neira, it turned out that the new fort was vulnerable to attack from the neighbouring hill. In 1611, therefore, Pieter Both ordered construction of a small fort – to be named Belgica – on these heights. A few years later an additional redoubt, named Neira, was constructed further on up the hill. In 1657, Georg Everhard Rumphius, better known for his botanical interests, was sent to Banda to design a new fort on top of the hill. His design was not realized, likely because of the high costs. Around 1660 these two fortifications were replaced by a new redoubt with the name Belgica II at the initiative of governor Van Dam. This redoubt was constructed with the use of recycled material from the two earlier fortifications and quickly dilapidated. At the initiative of Cornelis Speelman, Redoubt Belgica II was replaced from 1667 onwards by a new, much larger fort, the third construction to be named Belgica. Levelling the hill-top took until 1669, after which the fort was completed in 1672-1673. Engineer Adriaan de Leeuw, who had earlier designed new fortifications for Galle and Colombo, was responsible for the design of the new fort. He designed a two-tier concentric pentagonal fort. The outer ring consisted of a low wall with five angle-bastions, while the inner ring consists of higher walls and five round corner-towers. The walls of the inner ring house vaulted bomb-free storage and quarters for the garrison, and the new fort would be connected to fort Nassau through a tunnel. Although the fort had been expensive, costing a little over three hundred thousand guilders to build, and though there were persistent issues with leakage in three of the five corner towers, the fort proved satisfactory. It was soundly constructed and did not suffer damage from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, unlike other forts in the region. Belgica surrendered to the British without firing a shot in 1796 and again in 1810, having been handed back to the Dutch in 1803. In 1904 the towers were reduced in height as the assistant-resident was afraid that the high towers would attract enemy attention in case of an invasion. A local civic society was able to restore the tower sin 1935 after locals had won a lottery. The fort was comprehensively restored in 1991 and is now a tourist destination.

Especially during First and Second Esopus Wars, the colonists on the west bank of the Hudson River considered themselves to be in a dangerous location. It is therefore likely that soon after the foundation of the village of Bergen and its incorporation the decision was made to erect a palisade to defend the inhabitants against attacks by Native Americans. The new village was laid out in the customary shape of a rectangle with cross street, which encompassed the area now known as Bergen Square: Vroom Street, Van Reypen Street, Newkirk Street, and Tuers Avenue, and presumably the defence works enclosed that area. An ordinance of early 1662 refers to the completion of “a land gate and fence,” but unfortunately the original is too damaged to ascertain whether the original Dutch word being used is hek or palisaden. Two years later the villagers requested permission to build at “every gate a defensive blockhouse,” which was very likely also intended to provide a shelter for militia members charged with guard duty. Director general and council praised the zeal of the local magistrates and emphasized that absentee owners of lots were also “bound to assist in making the fortifications in question.”

Pekalongan at the north coast of Java was important for the Company as a supplier of rice and timber to Batavia. Fort De Beschermer (The Protector), which was built in 1753, is not situated at the coast but about three kilometers inland on the left bank of the Loji river. It has a rectangular shape of 79.5 x 60 meter with a half bastion on each corner. On each bastion was a small round sentry box. The entrance gate is in the south wall and small boats could moor before the door. The fort now functions as a state prison. The complex is in a good condition, but the original shape of the fort and functions of the buildings have changed. Of the four half bastions only the north east and south west bastion still exist. Watch towers on the bastions and the west and east wall guard the prisoners. Inside the fort are several buildings: barracks, offices, a club house, a prayer house and the original well. Most of the buildings function as prison cells. The entrance gate has been turned into a two-story entrance building, with the upper floor being used as the prison administration office.

The relations between the Swedes and the Dutch shifted from uneasy coexistence to outright rivalry when both nations decided to focus on the Schuylkill River and built fortifications there in proximity to each other. Presumably the building materials consisted of the “large quantities of pine logs,” which had been lying in the Schuylkill throughout the winter. A similar building method had been used for Fort Nya Gothenborgh (see above). In April 1648 Hudde was informed by Native American sachems that the Swedes had already built several buildings on the Schuylkill. As they invited him to do likewise, he quickly contacted Stuyvesant in New Amsterdam. After obtaining permission Hudde proceeded to build a Dutch fortification, called Fort Beversreede, next to the Swedish Fort Nya Korsholm that had been built in 1647. An exchange of protests with the Swedish commander lieutenant Måns Nilsson Kling ensued, but nevertheless Hudde pushed on with the work. He surrounded the house with palisades (palisaden) against Swedish attempts to destroy it, as they had done with a previous West India Company house downstream. Hudde adds: “I have erected a fort so that he might not also come here to do the same.” Later in 1648 the Swedes “built a house in front of Fort Beversreede, whereby the entrance to this fort was virtually closed off.” Later that autumn, one of the Swedes at night “to deride us pulled the palisades of Fort Beversreede apart and broke through them,” which suggests that the fortification was not as sturdy as Hudde would have liked. Fort Beversreede was abandoned when the Dutch built Fort Casimir. Johnson assumes that Fort Nya Korsholm was also abandoned in 1651, at the same time as Fort Nya Elfsborg. As the concentration of Swedish forces was a likely reaction to the building of Fort Casimir by the Dutch, Johnson's suggestion seems quite plausible. Native Americans burned down the abandoned Fort Nya Korsholm a few years later.

Beverwijck was created in 1652, when the West India Company asserted its jurisdiction to the area within 3,000 feet of Fort Orange, thus carving a new village out of the patroonship of Rensselaerswijck. As there were no fortifications in the area other than Fort Orange, which was in a bad condition, a number of structures were built in the ensuing years, including a guardhouse, a blockhouse church, and a palisade. - One of the first buildings to be constructed was a guardhouse (kortegaard), which is first mentioned in the records in 1654 and was likely built some time earlier. It was strategically located near the entrance to Beverwijck from the north. Although no details are known, both its location and the fact that it was also used as a prison, suggest that the guardhouse may have been a stronger construction than a regular house. However, its main function was to provide cover for the men on guard duty against the elements. - In 1655, plans were drawn up to construct a blockhouse in Beverwijck. In 1656 a square blockhouse of unknown size was built. Internally, it had a heavy wooden structure (gebinten) to provide extra support for the ordnance, which, according to Venema, were “mounted behind loopholes in the overhanging balconies,” i.e. at the upper level. The magistrates of Beverwijck brought in three light pieces, which had previously been positioned in the patroonship. The fortified building, which was also used as church, was located at the intersection in the middle of Beverwijck, with views along the roads leading north, west, and south. It was replaced by a stone building in 1715. - Although the blockhouse-church provided the colonists with some protection in case of an attack by the Indians, it did not constitute a perimeter defence, as Jan Baptist's remark highlights. The outbreak of war with the Esopus Indians in 1659 provided the impetus to build a stockade. Like the perimeter defence of New Amsterdam, the stockade at Beverwijck was constructed with horizontal planks, rather than with vertical rods. With a height of eight boards, the Beverwijck defence was slightly lower than the nine boards of New Amsterdam. Three weeks after the work was begun, the Beverwijck magistrates observed that the new palisade protected the village on the landside, the side of the river remained open. They therefore ordered owners of gardens on the river to build a fence of posts and planks, from seven to eight feet high, at the back of their property. A rough undated draft in the New York States Archives is very likely a sketch of the planned stockade of 1659. It is likely that the 1659 stockade had fallen into disrepair by 1670. In November of that year, the local authorities received instructions from the governor in New York to set off the entire circumference of Albany, as Beverwijck had been renamed, with “straight oaken posts, eleven feet long, the least of them to measure eight inches across at the thin end.” This suggests a vertical palisade, rather than a construction of horizontal planks.

The villages of Breuckelen and Nieuw Utrecht were first palisaded after director general and council in February 1660 sent councillor Nicasius de Sille to Long Island to implement defensive measures there. The timing was no coincidence: New Netherland was still involved in the First Esopus War and with spring near and the rivers becoming unfrozen, the chance of Indian raids even to Long Island was increasing. A new village, located on the East River near the ferry within sight of Fort Amsterdam, was to be fortified with a blockhouse (een blockhuijs tot haer defentie). But for the colonists living near the Waelebocht (Wallabout Bay) further east that location was inconvenient, not least because of the lack of suitable wells. Yet their request for a similar construction was denied. There are no references relating to the upkeep of these fortifications. \tThe 1660 ordinance for the enclosing of New Utrecht provides a few details that very likely also apply to the fortification works at Breuckelen. The inhabitants “shall collectively set palisades around their village in a proper manner,” with the absentee landowners fined six guilders per day unless they provided a substitute. In the middle of the village “a suitable blockhouse” was to be built, along with a gristmill, and a well. Trees outside the village had to be removed to provide good views. Yet it is likely that the blockhouse was not built until the summer of 1663, as Stuyvesant reported in early 1664.

Dutch ships visited Camocim in the beginning of the 17th century when the French maintained relations with the indigenous people living in the Serra de Ibiapaba (Hulsman 2008: 4). The Portuguese erected a small fortification during the campaign against the French in Maranhão. The Dutch drive in 1637 also expelled the Portuguese from Camocim and Barretto claims that a small Dutch fortification was in place during the period 1637-1644 (Barretto 2010: 56-57). Further archival research in Dutch archives is necessary to confirm this, though there are references in Dutch archives to a Dutch fortification in Camocim after 1649 (Wiesebron 2008: 522).

The struggle between New Sweden and New Netherland over control of the Delaware reached a critical phase when Dutch director general Petrus Stuyvesant made a voyage there in July 1651 and selected a location for a new Dutch fort, which was to replace Fort Nassau and Fort Beversreede. Stuyvesant first purchased all the land south of Fort Christina down to Bombay Hook (Boomtjes hoeck) from the Native Americans and ensured that the transaction was agreed upon in a format agreeable to European law. Then he selected “a reasonably suitable place [..] about a mile from the Swedish Fort Christina” to build a “fortress named Casimier,” which was furnished with “people and ammunitions of war, according to circumstances.” It has been suggested that he named the fort after Count Ernst Casimir van Nassau-Dietz, stadholder of Friesland from 1620-1632, but there is no direct documentary evidence to support this suggestion. During the First Anglo-Dutch which had broken out in 1652, the Swedes decided to try and conquer Fort Casimir. Swedish commander Johan Risingh, immediately upon his arrival on the Delaware River at the end of May 1654, sailed a ship up to the fort and sent out a sloop with twenty to thirty armed soldiers. As there was no gunpowder in the fort, the Dutch commander, sergeant Gerrit Bicker, decided to hand it over. He awaited the Swedish soldiers outside the fort, “in front of the gate,” which had been left open. Next Bicker, without giving any orders to his men, accompanied the Swedes into the fort where they easily overpowered the garrison of ten or twelve soldiers. Fort Casimir was renamed Fort Trefaldigheten (Fort Trinity), after Trinity Sunday, which in 1654 was May 31, the day it was captured. The Amsterdam directors were outraged by the behaviour of Gerrit Bicker, and called for his arrest. They also resolved to drive the Swedes from the river. For this purpose, they hired the warship <Waeg> which sailed for New Amsterdam at the end of May 1655. In the meantime, Swedish governor Johan Risingh had proceeded to strengthen Fort Trinity, by improving the walls and moving some cannon from his ship to the fort. These efforts, however, would prove of little avail. The Dutch expedition that sailed from New Amsterdam in 1655 consisted of four yachts, a galliot, a flute, and the warship Waegh, which had 36 guns. The smaller ships had about four guns each. The ships carried some 300 soldiers. New Sweden was quickly conquered. Stuyvesant appointed Jan Paul Jacquet as the new commander of Fort Casimir. Soon after his appointment, however, the West India Company directors in Amsterdam decided to transfer part of their possessions on the Delaware to the city of Amsterdam, in order to found a patroonship there under the name of New Amstel. Upon his arrival on 25 May 1657 Jacob Alrichs, vice-director of New Amstel, took formal possession of the fort, which, as he would soon complain, was in poor condition at the time. Alrichs found himself unable to repair the fort and improve other buildings according to his wishes, due to lack of building materials and provisions and the frequent outbreak of disease. After Alrichs himself succumbed to illness, command of the city colony passed on to Alexander d'Hinojossa, who took little care of the fortifications. The fort was in a bad condition when the English arrived in late 1664. Even so, d'Hinojossa and his troops refused to surrender. Thereupon Sir Robert Carr ordered a company of foot to land. Although the Dutch fired upon the soldiers, they managed to take the fort without losing a single man, killing three Dutch soldiers and wounding thirteen.

The VOC fort named 'Seith' or 'Ceijt' stood on the northern coast of Ambon island at the beach in Lebelehoe, west of the mouth of the river Hoeloe. During the uprising of the Hitu people under the leadership of Kakiali, the VOC built a wooden fort here in June 1643, with bastions on two of the opposite corners. The fort was used as a base for the campaign into the mountain fort Wawani. To keep a good eye on what was going on in the direct surroundings, the VOC forced the inhabitants of neighbouring villages Nau, Binau, Henelale, Henelatua and Henehelu to abandon their kampongs and settle near fort Seith. After the fall of Wawani Governor Gerard Demmer (1642–1647) held a meeting in fort Seith with the leaders of Hitu during which he declared that their land was now the property of the VOC. This was the political end of the war, although hostilities continued until 1646. In the years that followed the post was no longer of great importance. In 1656 only 8 men were stationed here. Despite this, in 1664–1665 the fort was rebuilt in stone, with an inside space of 13x13,5 meter and two meter tick walls. On February 17 1674 a tsunami hit Ambon, destroying many villages. More than 600 people of the villages of Seith, Lebelehoe and Wassela were killed. The fort was damaged. In 1697 the government in Ambon decided to reduce the costs by removing the soldiers of several outposts including Seith. Two years later the fort was only used by a 'posthouder' (guard) to prevent the smuggling of cloves. At present not much is left of the fort, only some parts of the foundations can still be found with the village of Seith.

Dussen described the fort in his report from December 1639 that was published by Barlaeus as being built of stone and having high walls. On the landside it had two half bulwarks with oreillons and casemates in the old fashioned style, but the curtains and the bulwarks were cramped and small. - The other sides have no flanks. It was constructed near the sea, beyond the dunes on the reef, a musket shot from the bar. A rifle shot distant there are dunes as tall or almost as tall as the fort, thus dominating the passages along the walls of the castle. Traverses were constructed along the walls to prevent these from receiving fire. This Castle has 10 pieces of bronze: 4 of 12 lbs, 1 of 10 lbs, 3 of 8 lbs, 1 of 7 lbs and 1 of 3 lbs, furthermore 16 pieces of iron: 1 of 6 lbs, 4 of 4 lbs, 7 of 3 lbs and 4 of 2 lbs in the casemates, 1 of 4 lbs and 2 of 3 lbs within the fore gate, all Spanish (Barlaeus 1923: 182). The report of Hamel, Bullestraten and Bas from 1646 describes the fort as having two bulwarks in the manner of hornworks with two casemates and having a protruding tenaille. 'The two other sides are curved to the inside in the manner of a tenaille, so that everything can be flanked in a reasonable way. One of the long sides facing the sea is in a bad way, but the Lord Directors have chosen to decline the proposal to repair it. For the rest the fort is well provided with quarters, an ammunition house and the following artillery.' - The garrison abandoned the fort in 1654 after the news of the rendition of Recife reached them and sailed to the Netherlands on a ship they had kept for that purpose by way of the Caribbean. The empty fort was occupied by Portuguese under the command of Colonel Francisco de Figueiroa.

When Peter Minuit arrived on the Delaware River in March 1638 and founded the New Sweden colony, the first fortification he established was Fort Christina on the Minquas Kill. Presumably he selected the location based on the existing trade routes with the Native Americans. According to Acrelius, writing over a century later, another argument for choosing the west bank for a “fortification” was “because of the Dutch,” as they had already settled on the east bank, i.e. at Fort Nassau. Fort Christina was located at about two miles from the Delaware River, which led Amandus Johnson to suggest it was Minuit's intention to avoid a direct confrontation with the Dutch, at least for the time being. It was a good location, as it had a good landing and was surrounded by marshland except on the north-eastern side, where a small strip of dry land provided access. Fort Christina was set up as a standard European-style fort: a square with four points. Three of the points were furnished with guns. The fort was built with palisades and earth. By autumn 1638 the fort was ready. It was solemnly named Christina by firing a salute. - After Minuit's demise in the Caribbean, Peter Hollander Ridder was eventually appointed as his successor. Arriving in New Sweden in early 1640, he found Fort Christina in poor condition, with the walls falling down in places, proving again the difficulties involved in maintaining earthwork defences in North America. Ridder ordered repairs to the breaks in the walls and also mended the existing ramparts, but as he required permission from Sweden for this, it is unlikely that any further work was done. Within Fort Christina, Ridder had three new houses built after the two old houses had been moved to the east side of the fort. In 1644, Fort Christina was commanded by Johan Papegoja, who had three soldiers at his disposal, as well as a trumpeter, a constable, and a marshal-provost, but presumably could also draw upon others employed by the New Sweden Company if the need arose. - A map made by Per Mårtensson Lindeström (not currently included in the AMH) gives an indication of what Fort Christina looked like at this point in time. Lindeström was a Swedish engineer, who had attended the University of Uppsala, specializing in mathematics and fortifications. After a stay of three years in New Sweden, he returned to Europe and in later life prepared his manuscript entitled “Geographia Americae eller Indiae Occidentalis beskrijffningh,” which was not published until the twentieth century. In New Sweden, Lindeström was commissioned to survey the fields near Fort Christina and divide them into plots. It must have been at this time that he produced a map that included Fort Christina. It shows how close the fort was to the creek. Risingh had great plans for Fort Christina and its surroundings. In June 1655 he reported that he expected additional buildings to be constructed when more colonists arrived. He planned to have these built “in the form of a city, where it seems best to place the staple town, since a port can be made and the place can be fortified against attack.” Risingh may have dwelt secure against attacks by the Natives, but Fort Christina surrendered quickly when the Dutch arrived in force in September 1655. Director General Stuyvesant received instructions not to maintain Fort Christina, but to keep only three or four soldiers there to ensure it remained in Dutch hands. Fort Casimir was to be the main West India Company stronghold on the Delaware - This changed when the Amsterdam directors granted Fort Casimir and the surrounding area to the city of Amsterdam as the New Amstel patroonship. Fort Christina, now renamed Fort Altena (although the old name was still used at times), became the main fort of the West India Company. The Amsterdam directors provisionally ordered Stuyvesant to occupy it with eight to ten soldiers, with the aim to protect the Company's Swedish subjects and to instill fear in potential enemies, both Native and European. In March 1660 the danger of an attack by the English in Maryland necessitated some repairs to the fort. Willem Beeckman, who had been appointed vice-director at the South River in 1658, asked Stuyvesant whether the batteries should be repaired with sods or beams. A month later he reported that they were “busy fitting the fortress with gabions and shall cut the decayed points down obliquely.” It is worth reminding that Beeckman had been in charge of making gabions in New Amsterdam four years earlier. It is likely that further attempts to reinforce Fort Altena were made in 1664. Fort Christina/Fort Altena is presumed to be located in what is now Fort Christina State Park on E. 7th Street in Wilmington, Delaware. The site is a National Historic Landmark and features the Fort Christina Monument. However, recent archaeological probing suggests that the park is located on filled-in wetlands rather than on the actual site of Fort Christina. The existence of any remains needs to be ascertained.

The Spaniards and the people of Tidore built the fort in 1637. Due to its location the fort controlled both the Palace of the Sultan of Tidore in Saosiu and the shipping through the Strait between Tidore and Halmaheira. The Spaniards briefly left the fort, but they returned in 1640. - In 1664 the Spaniards abandoned all their forts in the Moluccas and withdrew to the Philippines. The inhabitants of Ternate occupied the three empty Spanish forts (Cobo, Tahula and Rum) on the island and claimed them as their property. The Dutch East India Company demanded the demolition of the forts. After negotiations both parties reached an agreement in 1666. The forts Tahula and Cobo were transferred to the sultan and fort Rum dismantled. The sultan used fort Cobo as barracks for his European bodyguard. - After 1700 the fort fell into decline. In 1928, the only visible remains were the powder house, the gate, a part of the sea-bastion and the walls of some buildings. In 2007, a large part of the hill and the fort excavated for the construction of the coast road.

At the time, the modest stronghold with no bastions was given a battery for a maximum of six guns on the seaward side and had no ordnance at all on the landward side. Fort Collenburg remained in this ineffectual form until the end of the Company period, without any serious plans ever being made to improve or extend it.

Gemoenepa, now a section of Jersey City called Communipaw, was first settled in the 1630s. In 1658, the farmers living there petitioned for an exemption from tenths, which was granted on the condition that they would form a village. Three years later the villagers, who had not yet been granted lower jurisdiction and thus lacked authority to arrange matters themselves, asked director general and council to determine how they should palisade (affpalissaderen) their village. In reply, the colonial authorities provided them with details: to enclose the village the palisades had to be “of appropriate thickness and length, to about six to seven feet above ground level.” The villagers procrastinated, but the outbreak of further hostilities with the Esopus Indians in 1663 made improving their defences more urgent. They again received permission from director general and council “to enclose [the village] with long palisades.” It is presumed the village extended from what is now Communipaw Avenue on the north to the Bay Shore House on the south.

The first fort in this location was built in 1630 to protect the village of Wayer form pirates. This first fort was a small triangular construction. In 1732 it was replaced by the current fort : a square fort with three corner bastions. Originally it had been planned to construct four corner bastions, but design and construction were so poorly overseen that it was too late when it was descovered that the fourth bastion could not be constructed due to a lack of space. The site for the projected fourth bastion was occupied by the warehouse for nutmeg, which the company's officials were unwilling to demolish. The fort retained its garrison until the end of the colonial government monopoly on fine spices in 1864. It was auctioned off in 1887 and used as a source for building material afterwards. Still, the fort is relatively intact, only one bastion having been completely demolished.

The precious and aromatic sandalwood grew only on the islands Timor and Solor. The Dutch occupied in 1613 the Portuguese fort on Solor, which as fort Henricus became their base in this part of the Indonesian archipelago The fort was according to the economic and political situation occupied or temporary abandoned. The Portuguese had their base in Larentuka on Timor. The VOC traded directly from its ships with the local population on Timor. In 1653 captain Johannes Burgers and chief merchant Hendrick Ter Horst build a wooden fort in Kupang on Timor. After the small fort which has an encircling wall of 4 m high was completed, captain Burgers left provisions, ammunition, 28 soldiers and six sailors with a small boat and left for Batavia. The fort was afterwards protected by stone wall and with mantraps before the wall Fort Concordia was used to protect the trade and the local tribes (Sonnebaye and Amabi people) of the western part of Timor against the Portuguese . The fort became the nucleus of a small settlement In 1656 the Dutch and their Timorese allies suffered a crushing defeat in the battle of Mello mountain against the Pro-Portuguese tribes. Since that moment Timor was divided in a small western part around Kupang and a bigger Portuguese eastern part of the island - this formed the basis of the division of the island which in some form has persisted to this day. The high costs of having two forts in the same area were not compensated by the revenues of the other trade. Batavia decided to abandon Fort Henricus on Solor in 1657. The trade in sandalwood had completely declined and the trade in other local products was unimportant. The VOC lost her interest in the area. The garrison in Kupang served only political interest and the protection of the spice monopoly. The site of the fort has always been a military camp. The fort has been demolished and replaced by barracks of the KNIL and afterwards of the Indonesian army. The only remains of fort Concordia are foundation walls and gravestones

When, in February 1781, the British conquered the colony during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, they did fortify the rivier mouth, apparently drawing on the Dutch plans. When, one year later, the French conquered the colony, they demolished that fort and built a new one, named Fort le Dauphin, closer to the mouth of the river. When in 1783 the colony was returned to the Netherlands, the fort came to be known as Willem Frederik and Kroonprins. - The main French fortification was located approximately where indicated. On the west bank, there was a supporting battery named 'La Reine'.

In 1656 governor Arnold de Vlaming van Outshoorn brought the remote Ambonese island of Buru under control of the VOC. The following year governor Jacob Hustaert (1656–1662) signed a treaty with the chiefs of Buru to destroy all clove trees –to control the VOC monopoly- and to concentrate the island inhabitants in one village in the Bay of Kayeli. Here the VOC built a wooden barricade, called Mandersjah (named Sultan Mandarsyah of Ternate, the official ruler of Buru). In 1661, on request of the local population, Simon Cos replaced the temporary wooden construction by a stone redoubt and named it after himself. Orders from Batavia forced him however to change the name from Cosburg into Oostburg. In 1668 the fort was damaged and plundered during a revolt. When order was restored it was repaired. In 1689 during the visit of governor Dirk de Haas (1687-1691) the powder house accidentally exploded and the fort burned down. On the same spot a wooden fort was now built, called Defensie. Under governor Bernardus van Pleuren (1775-1785) the primitive wooden stronghold by a proper stone fort. In the period 1778-1787 four men overlooked the design and construction of the new fort: Lambertus Jansz. Haga, Wijnandus Johannes de Bourghelles de la Vacquerie, Jan Bruyns en Elias Mazel. Their names can still be seen chiseled in the fort. The fort consisted of a square with four with a half-bastion at each of the four corners. The fort remained in service well into the 19th century. It had a garrison of about 25 men under a lieutenant until it finally lost its permanent military function in 1867. The ramparts of the fort, complete with bastions, sentry boxes and gates, have survived to this day. The buidlings which once stood inside and surrounding the fort have disappeared.

The small island of Kisar lies north of East-Timor. It is part of an island group which was known to the Dutch as the Southwest Islands. In 1668 the VOC settled on Kisar which until then had stood under Portuguese control. Initially the Dutch took over the old Portuguese fort, which was renamed Delfshaven. In line with the Portuguese building tradition, this stronghold was built linand, on a hill. The Dutch, on the other hand, preferred to have their defences right at the waterline and started building a new fort on the beach. Once fort Vollenhoven was completed the old fort in Kota Lama was abandoned. From the new position the bay and the gorge that providing access to the inland could be controlled. In 1819 the island lost its military function. In de meantime a mixed population had evolved, influenced by both the Portuguese and the Dutch. Until this day there are families on Kiser with Dutch family names. The European influence can also still be seen in the islands buildings. In 1848 fort Vollenhoven was describes as a square structure with three meter high and one meter thick walls made out of rocks, with bastions on two of its opposite corners and a gate on the east side. Fort Delfshaven was in a worse state. In the meantime things seem to have changes and less is left of fort Vollenhoven, at hen of fort Delfshaven. From the later some wall fragments of the structure that once measures 21x28 meters still stand in Kota Lama.

In 1671 the VOC wanted Dutch and native people to cultivate the spice trees on Obi. The main reason was to prevent other European merchants from collecting spices on the islands. In 1672, the Dutch unsuccessfully tried to negotiate with the sultan of Bachian about the construction of a fort on Obi. After an outbreak of War in Europe between the Dutch Republic, France and England, the island was occupied by the VOC. Governor General Joan Maetsuyker (1653-1678) told the sultan that the occupation was a temporary measure to prevent the English from to occcupying the island. Cornelis Francs (Governor of the Moluccas 1672-1674) built a small wooden fort on the west coast of Obi in 1674 . Fort De Bril had a garrison of 24 men. The plans for emigration of inhabitants of Ceram to Obi in order to start spice production for the VOC became a great failure, and the Company was content to just keep competitors away from then on. It proposed to sultan Alawadin II of Bacian that he sell the islands to them, as they had no value for him. In 1679 the sultan rented the Obi Islands to the Dutch East India Company and in 1682 he sold it for 700 rijksdaalders. - Robert Padbrugge (Governor of the Moluccas 1677-1682) ordered the construction of the small stone fort Den Briel in 1678. The garrison was reduced to seven men. This was possible because during the regular hongi tours all the clove and nutmeg trees on the island were destroyed. Ships patrolled the area to prevent smuggling of spices. The post holders on Obi were recalled in 1696. The Governor of the Moluccas complained about the smuggling. Batavia put an embargo on the trade on the Obi Islands. In 1700 was fort Den Briel again occupied. First with seven but later with fewer men depending on the circumstances. After rumors of Spanish infiltration and smuggling in 1733, extra people were sent to the outposts, including Obi. In 1758 the garrison finally left because the island was unhealthy. The Dutch East India Company placed a stone marker with its logo and the letter N (Netherlands) in the neighborhood of the fort, to show that it was part of their territory. The fort fell into disrepair. - During the survey in 2007 the walls of the fort were still standing. The site was threatened because the nickel-mining company that owns the site wanted to build a road to the mine uphill. On Google Earth 2011 there are no longer any visible remains of fort den Briel.

This small redoubt defended the nutmeg plantation Dender on the northern coast of the island of Lonthor. It was built in 1626 on the recommendation of Governor Willem J. Admiraal. The redoubt, like a whole chain of similar fortifications built on Lonthor in this period, was meant to control the slaves on the nutmeg plantations and to counteract landing attempts of pirates. A small square redoubt whose main goals were to control the slaves on the nutmeg plantations and to counteract landing attempts of pirates. As such, the fort formed a part of a chain of similar fortifications on the island of Lonthor. It was in use until the termination of the colonial government's policy to monopolize on nutmeg in 1864, after which it was abandoned and fell into decay. Currently, only some fragments of walls remain.

The fort had to prevent smuggling over the river to the city. On the map by Reimer (1778) the fort and the mouth of the Wester River are 400 metres from the sea because of the river silting up.

On the south coast of the island of Saparua, which was very important to the VOC because of the trade in cloves, on the top of a cliff above Sirisori, stands the monumental Fort Duurstede. It succeeded fort Fort Hollandia dating from 1671 which was located on a less strategic point. The construction of Fort Duurstede started in 1690 and was finished in 1691 under Governor of Ambon, Nicholas Schagen (1691-1696) who considered the fort to be one of the best structures built under his supervision. The move from Fort Hollandia to Fort Duurstede took place in 1692. In the new fort 10 soldiers and one corporal took their residence. When a number of other forts were abandoned the importance of Fort Duurstede as a centre of VOC administration increased, eventually more troops were stationed here. The most significant historical event however took place here after the time of the VOC. In May 1817 the fort was attacked by the Saparua people under the command of Thomas Matulesia (Pattimura Muda), a Christian Ambonese who had served as sergeant-mayor in the British Army. All the inhabitants of the fort were killed except the young son of the resident, Jan Rudolf van den Berg. The rebellion was eventually broken and Fort Duurstede returned to the Dutch while Thomas Matulesia was taken prisoner. Together with a number of his fellow rebels he was hanged at Fort Victoria mid-December that same year. After Indonesian independence Thomas Matulesia was acknowledged a national hero and he was given the name Pattimura. Fort Duurstede thus has a special place in Indonesian history. Fort Duurstede stands on a hill along the coast of Saparua village. Because of its relatively high location, it can be observed from the whole bay and surrounding hamlets. It has an elongated diamond-shaped structure. This very uncommon ground plan results from the form of the cliff. In the north and south corners semi-circular bastions are built, provided with embrasures. Old cannons are still found at some of the embrasures. Entrance into the fort is through a small gate in the north east, with 24 steps made of stone. Above the gate stand the VOC monogram an is chiselled the name of the person who ordered the building of the fort and the year of construction. The fort was made of coral stone with a wall of about 3.4 meters high. The south wall directly borders the sea. Previously there were several buildings inside the fort, such as the commander's house, houses for the physician and staff, storage for cloves and ammunition, offices, water reservoirs and bathing facilities with sufficiently clean and potable water. At present, however, all those buildings have become ruins and only the foundations can still be seen. There are some ruinous structures inside the fort, these are remnants of buildings that were erected during the initial period of Indonesia's independence. In 1977-1978 the fort was restored and a reception hall was added on the north east wall. In 1995 the fort was restored and it has since been a popular attraction for tourists.

The Swedes constructed this short-lived fort, called Elsenburgh by the Dutch, in 1643 on the orders of the newly arrived governor Johan Printz. Its location was chosen in order to neutralize Dutch Fort Nassau. In order to do so, it was constructed further south on the Delaware River, where the Varkens Kill (present-day Salem Creek) enters into Delaware Bay. When David Pietersz de Vries visited the Delaware in 1643, he dropped anchor before the fort and “sailed landward, to the fort, which was not quite completed; it was made in the English fashion, with three points close by the side of the river and there lay six or eight metal pieces on it, of twelve pound iron.” A year later, in 1644, Johan Printz reported that “Elfsborg [was] now (especially on the one side) [..] so secure that there is no need to fear any attack (if it is not entirely too severe).” At this point in time, the fort had a garrison of 16 men, commanded by Sven Sküte. According to the report by Andries Hudde, Fort Nya Elfborg was “ordinarily garrisoned with twelve men and a lieutenant; four twelve-pounders, both iron and brass, and one pots-hooft [an artillery piece fashioned from iron instead of being cast].” It was “constructed of earthworks.” The purpose of the fort was to control access to the river, keeping it closed to all except Swedish ships. As Andries Hudde reports, several of the Company yachts coming from Manhattan were fired upon from the fort. No fatalities ensued, which suggests the fort's location and the reach of its guns were not sufficient to achieve its intended purpose. The fort was nicknamed Fort Myggenborgh (Fort Mosquito) as the nearby swamp made the insects a veritable pest. Many soldiers on the fort succumbed to malaria. After Fort Casimir was built on the other side of the Delaware in 1651, the Swedes abandoned Fort Nya Elfsborg. By 1655, “the fortress of Elfsborg [..] lay in ruins.” The original site is offshore at Elsinboro Point, four miles southwest of Salem near the Fort Elfsborg-Salem Road (County Highway 625), where two historic markers are located. In 2012 an unsuccessful search was undertaken to locate remains. As Craig Lukezic suggests, changes in the landscape, for instance as the result of storms or floods, have been extensive, making it possible that the site of Fort Elfsborg is now covered by the river.

Midwout and Amersfoort, two Dutch villages on Long Island, were defended by palisades in May 1656, after pressure from director general and council. Unsurprisingly, keeping the defences in a good condition proved to be a difficult task for the two villages. In February 1660, in an attempt to strengthen the defences of the villages on Long Island, director general and council ordered the magistrates to assign a portion to each inhabitant with the instruction to inspect it every fortnight and undertake repairs when required. The center of Midwout was located at the intersection of what now are Flatbush and Church avenues. Amersfoort was located about four kilometres to the south, at the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Kings Highway. In both cases, the exact whereabouts of remnants of the palisade (if extant) needs to be ascertained.

In June 1630 it was decided that a pentagonal fortification should be constructed south of the main quarter which later became known as Fort Frederik Hendrik or Fort Vijfhoeck. In August 1631 the construction was contracted together with the fortification of the Groot Quartier. Dussen described the fort in 1639 as having five bulwarks and a large moat, surrounded by a strong counterscarp and provided with strong palisades. A large hornwork covered all of the high ground near the fort, the rest of the terrain flooded regularly so there was no place where an enemy could lodge himself. The fort was rendered in 1654 and became known as Forte de São Tiago, Forte das Cinco Pontas or Forte das Cacimbas. It was conserved and today is a public Museum called Museu da Cidade.

The precious and aromatic sandalwood, which grew only on Timor and Solor , was sold on markets in China. The Portuguese Dominican friars were the first Europeans who traded with these islands. Around 1557 they settled in Lahayong on Solor and started with missionary work. In 1561 they build a stockade as temporary protection against slave traders from Makassar and in 1566 a stone fort. In 1613 the Dutch captain Apollonius Schot conquered the Portuguese fort after a long siege. The thousand people inside, most woman and children got a safe conduct to Malacca. Adriaen van der Velde became the first commander of the fort, which was called Fort Henricus. The trade of sandalwood was quite booming. However in 1615 the sandalwood trade was no longer deemed lucrative and the Council of the Indies in Batavia decided to abandon and demolish Fort Henricus. The trade should be conducted by private traders from now on. In 1616 the Portuguese under padre Joăo das Chagas reoccupied the ruined fort, but they left Solor soon afterwards and went to Timor. Governor General Jan Pietersz. Coen realized the VOC had made a mistake to abandon Solor. He sent merchant Crijn Van Raemburch to the island in 1618 to build a new redoubt. In 1620 the redoubt, which was square with four corners, housed 23 European soldiers and 80 Solor inhabitants, members of the family of important indigenous leader Kitchil Protavi, and 17 Chinese. The sandelwood trade came to a standstill because of political unrest in China and was no longer profitable. In 1628 Batavia ordered that fort Henricus should be dismantled and blown up to prevent that the Portuguese should use the buildings. In the future the trade with Timor should be done from the ships. In 1633 the Portuguese occupied the ruined fort, made some repairs and left a garrison of 25 men. In 1623 chief merchant Jan Tombergen arrived with a fleet of the VOC and chased the Portuguese from the fort. The Dutch departed and the fort was empty again. Governor General Cornelis van der Lijn decided in 1645 to once again station soldiers in the fort. The 34 man should prevent a Portuguese occupation. Three years later an earthquake demolished a part of the fort. In 1653 the VOC built fort Concordia in Kupang on Timor. The high costs of having two forts in the same area were not compensated by the revenues of the trade. In 1657 Fort Henricus was abandoned. The widow of Kitchil Protavi, Injay Chili, wrote a letter to Governor General Joan Maetsuyker to send arms and ammunition to defend het people against the Portuguese. In 1667 the ruined fort was occupied again for political reasons. Two man and several canons were send to Solor. This minimal occupation manned Fort Henricus until 1760. In 1982 an earthquake destroyed the main part of the fort. The site is filled with houses and corn fields.

The town of Goiana is situated near the border of Pernambuco with Paraíba. At the time of the Dutch invasion t was one of the sugar-producing areas. It was occupied by WIC troops on 12 January 1635. The WIC had a fortified camp half an hour from Goiana near the river Capivaribi (Laet 1937: 134-135). De Laet mentions that a Dutch fortification called Capiveribi near Goiana was attacked by Camarão in March 1636. Help arrived on 16 March, but the Portuguese had already withdrawn. No further references to this fortification have been found. Further research will be necessary (Laet 1937: 235-236).

The island the Native Americans called “Pagganck” (“nut trees”) is one of the locations where colonists under the jurisdiction of the Dutch West India Company first settled in 1623/1624. While little first-hand information is available about the activities of the colonists, the instructions for Willem Verhulst, drawn up in Amsterdam in January 1625, refer to a “fort on Noten Island.” This makes it likely that the settlers erected a defensive structure, probably a blockhouse, in order to defend themselves after the ocean-going ships had departed for Europe. A possible location for a small fort was near the wind-powered sawmill that is depicted on the 1639 Manatus map (fig. 2) in the northwestern corner of the island. Presumably this fort fell out of use when the colonists moved to Manhattan soon afterwards. Considering the subsequent use of Governors Island, especially in the nineteenth century, it was considered unlikely that traces could be found. But in the late twentieth century, subsurface testing in the northeastern corner of the Governors Island National Historic Landmark district identified structural remains of what could be either the sawmill or a defensive structure. Yet this location does not agree with the 1639 Manatus map. An alternative location for the original Dutch fortification is the center of the original island, as suggested by Oscar Hefting and Hans van Westing after visual inspection in 2012. Thus the remains of the first Dutch fort could be buried under Fort Jay, which dates from the late eighteenth century. Further research, using eighteenth-century documentation and for instance including a geophysical survey of the open area around Fort Jay, is required.

Like other villages in New Netherland, Gravesend was ordered to construct a palisade after the attack on New Amsterdam of September 1655 had given rise to fear for further Native American hostilities. In April 1656, the magistrates of Gravesend, who had earlier applied for and were granted a small garrison, reported that they had “enclosed their village with palisades.” To reinforce the village further, they asked to be provided with three or four cannon and munitions of war. After deliberation, director general and council allowed them the use of two pieces, as well as fifty pounds of powder and twelve balls of four pound each. The palisaded area lies between Van Sicklen Street, Village Road North, Village Road East, and Village Road South and according to Paul Huey it is very likely that these stockades can be located.

The outbreak of the Second Esopus War provided a new impetus for fortifications in the patroonship of Rensselaerswijck. At the end of June 1663, Johannes La Montagne reported to Stuyvesant that the patroonship claimed three of the guns at Fort Orange, “to place them at the Green Bush in a little fort or fortification, which they build there.” It is likely that this refers to the location now known as Crailo State Historic Site, but the documentary evidence does not allow pinpointing the site. Recent excavations between the front of the 1740s house to the street and under the sidewalk along the street revealed evidence of a deep trench that could have been a stockade trench. Seventeenth-century artefacts were found, but the archaeological evidence is as yet inconclusive.

In 1651 governor Arnold de Vlaming van Outshoorn ordered to build a wooden fort near the village called Negeri Lima. In 1655 this first defensive structure was replaced by a square stone blockhouse, called Haarlem. Eventually this structure was neglected for quite some time and collapsed. In 1817 commissioner-general Buyskes ordered a new blockhouse to be built on its ruins, with the objective to fight the pirates and to protect nearby hamlets. The new blockhouse was named after Baron Van der Capellen, who visited it in 1824. Around 1860 the structure was abandoned and fell into ruin. In 2013 a flood destroyed the remains of the blockhouse, so that only the foundations presently remain.

In order to maintain a tighter rein over the Ceylonese interior, the Company built a string of forts along the River Kelani of which Fort Hanwelle was the largest. The complex included a house for the fiscal - a sort of glorified bookkeeper - and warehouses for provisions and herbs. According to the sources the fort was manned by the outcasts of the Company who were not particularly wanted in Colombo, the capital.

The fort replaced a temporary fortification at the seaside, was made by Coen during his campaign on the Banda islands in 1621. - Willem Jansz (r. 1623-1627) oversaw construction as the governor of Banda during construction was during the construction of the fort governor of Banda. His successor Peter Vlack (r. 1627-1628) changed the name in 1628 in fort Hollandia. - The plan of the fort is square with four bastions at the corners and one gate at the landside. The walls of coral stone are seven meter high and one meter thick. - The fort and the kampong (village) Lonthoir, which are on top of a 20 meter high hill, could be reached by climbing a stair with 313 steps. The seaside of the hill is too steep to climb. Governor Joannes van Dam (1661-1665) dug a moat of 24 feet wide and 10 feet deep around the fort. - The fort's guns commanded the strait between the island Lonthoir and Gunung Api. On the beach below the fort was a ravelin, but that was destroyed by an earthquake and a tsunami in 1711. - The fort controlled not only the shipping lane, but was also a defense against slave revolts. The VOC had divided Banda in so called perken (nutmeg estates), which were leased to European perkeniers. The work on the plantations was done by slaves. In 1710 the fort was used in the suppression of such a slave revolt. - In 1741 fort Hollandia was damaged by an earthquake. - In 1796 governor François van Boekholtz (1794-1796) took measures to defend the Banda islands against a British attack. He retreated to fort Belgica on Neira but had the small forts like Hollandia repaired. After the occupation of the island in 1811 the fort was neglected and fell into decay. Today the land bastions no longer exist.

Initially the VOC only built a wooden hut to store trading goods at the village of Sirisori on the island of Saparua. Later palisade fencing was added and in 1626 under Governor Jan van Gorkum (1625–1628) the construction of a small fort was started. In 1633 this structure was damaged by an earthquake. In 1654 under governor Arnold de Vlaming van Outshoorn (1654-1656) the structure was expanded and built in stone. It was then that it was given the name Hollandia. In 1671 again the fort was hit by an earthquake. In the years that followed plans were made to rebuilt a fort here, but these plans were never fully realised. In 1685 the VOC hierarchy decided to abandon the fort in order to save money. In 1692 the remaining VOC personal moved to the newly built fort of Duurstede some five kilometres to the west. Today only the some wall fragments and parts of the foundation of fort Hollandia remain.

On the north coast of Haruku island lies fort Hoorn. Initially in 1656 governor Arnold de Vlaming van Oudshoorn (1647-1656) commissioned the construction of a simple post made of wooden and palm leaves. With a sergeant and twenty soldiers from here the village of Pelauw and its surroundings could be controlled. Although at first this post was thus meant to suppress the villagers living along the coast of Haruku, later it was they themselves asked the VOC to improve the stronghold to protect them from Papua pirates. Under governor Bernardus van Pleuren (1775-1785) what had been known as the little look outpost Hoornwas transformed into a true fort called Nieuw Hoorn. The construction costs were split between the VOC and the villagers. The design for the fort was made by artillery-lieutenant Strick. The small fort had strong walls with a half-bastions built on each of its four corners. It was guarded by a corporal with six soldiers and four cannons. In the years that followed the fort was not permanently used. Troops were only deployed here if it was judged to be necessary. In 1817 during the rebellion at Haruku, the fort was again put in use. Pelauw mostly remained unharmed because the Radja of Pelauw fought on the Dutch side. Today the form of the fort is still clearly visible and most part of the walls still stand, although the western bastion on the sea side of the fort has partly collapsed.

While it is likely that early fur traders, such as Adriaen Block and Cornelis Hendricksz, also explored the Connecticut River, there is no proof they established a permanent presence. Noticing English interest, the West India Company sent Jacob van Curler to purchase land there and to establish a trading post on the river in order to support its claim to the area. In June 1633 Van Curler began building “the trading house named the Hope” , but this did not stop English colonists from developing similar plans as a group under the leadership of William Holmes started a settlement a little further upstream, thus cutting off the fur trade route. Protests to and fro were issued, insults exchanged, and injuries inflicted, with neither side willing to budge for two decades. \t\t\tWhile the building is called a “fort” in some of the Dutch documents, little information is available as to what it actually looked like. William Bradford described it as a “slight forte”, with “2 peeces of ordnance”. According to a protest drawn up in 1642, i.e. nine years later, it consisted of a blockhouse, furnished with a garrison and ordnance. In 1641, the English surrounded the house with a fence of palisades, in order to stop the Dutch from accessing land claimed by them. This suggests that a perimeter fortification had not been constructed earlier. By 1647, the House the Hope was reported to be in need of repair. Despite being outnumbered on the Connecticut the Company officials in New Amsterdam decided to maintain it in order to keep up the honour of the West India Company. The end of House the Hope came in 1653, during the First Anglo-Dutch War. \t\tThe exact location of the House the Hope is obscure in some of the early documentary sources. The creek De Vries refers to is the Park River, nowadays subterranean. It is presumed that House the Hope was located on what was formerly known as Dutch Point, on the north side of Park River. However, according to Paul Huey, it may a bit further south, at the junction of Whitehead Highway and Interstate 91, where nineteenth-century maps show a landing site. It is possible that the work carried out in 1940 on Park River by the Army Corps of Engineers left part or all of the location of House the Hope unscathed.

In 1662, a number of colonists settled west of Wiltwijck in a hamlet that was indicated as “Nieuw Dorp” (New Village). They quickly met with enmity of the Esopus Indians who disputed their ownership of some of the land. In April 1663 the villagers asked Director General Stuyvesant for a small garrison, in anticipation of the building of defence works, an indication that these had not been erected as yet. Two months later, the village was attacked. After the conclusion of peace with the Esopus Indians in May 1664, Stuyvesant ordered three to four hundred hemlock planks for the construction of a stockade at the new village in the Esopus, but it is not clear from the documentary record whether they were actually delivered and put to use. It must be considered unlikely, as there is no mention of a village at the location until Hurley was resettled and named in 1669.

The post Indramayu, a collection point and loading station for rice and wood bound for Batavia, was guarded by a redoubt from 1681 onwards. This redoubt was classified in 1853 as 4th class permanent defensive structure (against a native enemy). In 1863, the military unit and its artillery pieces were removed, and civilian government took care of the post, to be reused in case local war arise. In 1865, the redoubt was definitely removed from the list of permanent defensive structures. Today there is only a small part of a wall left.

The <schans> (earthwork) Jacatra, which was designed by surveyor Johannes Listingh, lay on a strategic location at the Great River to the southeast of the city. - Around 1700 the earthwork was replaced with a stone fort with four bastions. In 1744, the garrison consisted of one officer, three or four sergeants, a surgeon, gunners and 25 to 36 soldiers. The fort was demolished in 1809 by order of Governor General Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811). - On the modern map of Jakarta the site of the fort would be located at Jalan Pisang Baru (East side of Gunung Sahari) near the intersection with Jalan Pangerrang Jayakarta.

Around 1719 the reinforced lodge in Japara was replaced by a fort with four half bastions and a small square fort was built on the Danareja height. In 1741 the city and the fort withstood the assaults of Chinese and Mataram rebels. The High Government in Batavia decided to enlarge the fort on the height by a larger triangular fort. In 1774 the garrison in the fort consisted of on sergeant, two corporals and sixteen soldiers. In 1830 the buildings inside the fort were demolished, but the batteries remained. The fort was listed as a defense work of the 4th category (against a native enemy). The canons were removed in 1862, but the civil administration had to maintain the fort to use it in case of an emergency. In 1870 Japara was officially removed from the list of defense works in the Dutch East indies. Fifty years later the gate and the wall were still there, but the earthen support of the walls has been removed. The gate and a part of the wall were later demolished to make a road for the construction of houses on the hill. Currently, the walls have been repaired. The very large new gate doesn't resemble the original gate. The fort is a public park and a is used as a passageway by the local people.

Fort Jemseg, a French fortified trading post located on the east bank of the Jemseg River in what now is New Brunswick, was briefly conquered by Dutch Frigate captain Jurriaen Aernoutsz, commanding the Vliegende Paert van Curacao, in 1674, during the Franco-Dutch War. After conquering the French fort Pentagouet further south in what is now Castine, Maine (US), Aernoutsz sailed on to Fort Jemseg and also captured that fort. Returning south, Aernoutsz sold the guns (tout le canon) of Fort Pentagouet in Boston to governor John Leverett of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Before interested parties from New York, such as Cornelis Steenwijck and John Rhoade, could enforce the Dutch claim, the English briefly took possession before the area returned to French rule. Most of the documents related to the Dutch attack on Acadia deal with the aftermath and contain little detail about the capture of Fort Pentagouet and Fort Jemseg or of the material condition of the fortifications. It is clear however that the activities of the Dutch forces during their brief stay were mostly of a destructive nature.

The first Dutch fort near Sumenep, which mainly supplied agricultural products to the VOC, was built in 1705 and stood near the mouth of the river. It had both a civil and military function and was under command of a merchant or a non-commissioned officer. But in 1780, a military commandant was appointed to be in charge of the fort. In 1783-1785 a fort was built in Kalimo'okok on a hill 200 meter north of river Marengan. The site of the fort was about three kilometer from the sea and seven kilometer from the city. The new fort was square with four bastions on the corners. There were two entrances: the main gate in the southern wall and a smaller gate in the northern wall. The walls were 1,3 meter thick and circa 4.1 A lieutenant was in command of the garrison of 25 till 30 European soldiers. The fort was armored with four cannon. During the British occupation of java and Madura in 1811 there was a fierce battle near Sumenep. Major William Thorn, who participated in the campaign wrote that the fort was much out of repair, on the wrong location and was used as a depot. Around 1847 the fort was in a good condition. Untill 1871 it was listed as a permanent fort of the 4th category against a native enemy. During the Japanese occupation (1942-1945) the fort was used as a hospital. Madura is an important supplier of salt and after the Indonesian independence the fort was used as a salt warehouse. Today it is used by the Farming Office as a quarantine for cattle.

Fort Kijk in den Pot was built at a strategic position on the island of Gunung Api, in the middle of the Lonthor strait. Ships passing through this passage naturally came within firing range of the fort's cannon. Being located on Gung Api, the fort suffered from earthquakes and vulcanic eruptions. Built in 1664 as a coastal battery, it was extended and modified until it collapsed in an earthquake in 1683. It was then rebuilt and would again be rebuilt in 1762 as a semicircular battery with a half-moon.. As the opinions on the defense of Banda changed repeatedly throughout the years, the fort was repeatedly abandoned only to be taken back in service a couple of years later. It was ultimately retained well into the first half of the nineteenth century. At present, some remnants remain.

In the 1640s and 1650s, a small number of colonists had settled in the Middle Hudson River Valley, in an area along the river just south of the Catskill Mountains, where the Esopus Creek and the Rondout Creek had created fertile floodplains. The first settlement was located on the flood plain and surrounding areas that offered little natural protection. In 1658, increasing tensions with the Esopus Indians spurred on the concentration of the settlers in a single location, which could then be fortified with a stockade (palissaden). - The inhabitants and the soldiers that Stuyvesant had brought with him began the work of digging a ditch or furrow (grep), cutting palisades and hauling them to the selected location with six or seven wagons. The description of the work being carried out stipulates that the palisades were sharpened and put upright, indicating a perimeter defence of vertical rods. Stuyvesant's report indicates that the colonists did the digging and the soldiers constructed the stockade and this also suggests that the grep refers to a narrow trench in which the logs were erected. - The 1658 palisade served the village well when hostilities broke out again the following year. In some documents relating to the First Esopus War (1659-1660), during which the stockaded village withstood an eight-day siege, it is referred to as “the fortress” (fort). It had at least two gates, as at some point in time a group of soldiers was ordered to exit through one gate (poorte) and return through the other. Another detail that emerges is the presence of some ordnance (stucken), presumably light swivel guns. - Two years later, Wiltwijck's population increase necessitated an expansion of the stockaded area. In May 1661, thirteen lots were granted to new settlers, on the condition that they would enclose it on the outside with “good, stout and suitable palisades.” Some inhabitants did not do so immediately, while others made openings in the palisades, so as to exit the village quickly. In November 1662, the authorities tried to increase security by ordering the colonists to close the openings with palisades or doors that could be properly locked, in which case the keys had to be deposited at the guardhouse every night. - The defences of the village seemed to have been kept in a reasonable condition, but did not prevent an Indian attack in June 1663. Under the pretext of trade, a large group of Esopus Indians entered the village in broad daylight, only to suddenly attack the colonists. Eighteen inhabitants were killed and a large number was captured before the Indians were driven off. - The 1658 stockade was built on a promontory bluff overlooking the Esopus Creek and floodplains to the north, located at the northeastern edge of what is now the Kingston Stockade District. This is what Stuyvesant meant when he remarked upon the location being “by nature [..] properly defensible.” Stuyvesant's report indicates that the 1658 stockade had a circumference of ca. 210 rods, either the Rijnlandse roede of 3.767 meters or the Amsterdamse roede of 3.68 meters. This means the circumference of the 1658 stockade was about 775 meters, its boundaries being Clinton Street to the east, North Front Street to the North, John Street to the south, and cutting through the current block between Wall Street and Crown Street to the west. The 1661 expansion added thirteen lots and moved the western perimeter defence to the current location of Green Street. Further expansion, this time to the south, took place in 1669-1670 and 1676-1677, extending the southern boundary of the village to current Main Street (see fig. 14). - The stockade area of Kingston has been the subject of seven archaeological investigations, during some of which evidence of the fortifications was uncovered. Remains of the 1658 stockade were discovered in 1970 and 1971 during an excavation on the eastern side of Clinton Avenue in front of the Senate House, i.e. the northeastern part of the stockade. Postmolds were found at a depth of 33.2 to 45.72 cm and indicate that the palisades varied considerably in size (7.62 to 33.2 cm), which is interpreted as a sign of frequent repairs. Photographs of the excavation suggest that the palisades were not placed in a ditch and subsequently backfilled, but were excavated and pounded in. However, during the investigation of the Matthwis Persen House a section of the 1661 palisade was excavated, which did show the use of a trench and backfill to erect the posts. Finds also included a burn layer from the attack of 7 June 1663 and cannonballs from a four-pounder gun, which may also have been used in 1663, though probably not during the attack but afterwards.

Not much is known about this fort at Wokam which for a long time would have been the easternmost Dutch stronghold in the archipelago. It lies within the Aru-islands, south of New Guinea. Today the fort and the nearby village are known as Kota Lama, simply meaning old town. Wokam was the biggest settlement on the Aru-Islands. In 1659 the VOC built a fort here to control the growth and trade of nutmeg on the island. Dutch historian François Valentyn visited the post around the end of the 17th century. He noted the fort consisted of palisades and was guarded by a sergeant, a corporal and about 10 soldiers. The remote VOC post was apparently abandoned in 1792 after local uprising. In the nineteenth century several Dutch visors made note of the ruins of the fort, which apparently had been built in stone at some point, with a blockhouse defense tower. The remains of this structure, a well and the church built next to it with were still in use in 1840 and are still visible today. The ruins stand about 20 meters from the waterline in the midst of a coconut plantation. The wall segments that still stand form two rooms sized 10 x 14,5 meter each. The remnants are mostly overgrown.

The small redoubt Kuilenburg was built in 1636 on the northern end of the island of Banda Besar (Lonthor). Built on top of a hill, it guarded the northernmost part of the island as well as the passage between the islands of Lonthor and Neira. It was accessible from the village of Salomon by means of a flight of stone stairs running up the hill. It was built at the orders of Governor-General Antonie van Diemen, who named it Kuilenburg after his hometown of Culemborg. Acoording to an inscription, Governor Willem van der Zijl (1680-1682) rebuilt the redoubt in 1682. It was a typical redoubt for the Moluccas, consisting of a stone tower, accessible at the top by means of a wooden ladder, covered by a steep tiled roof. Though parts of the structure were still intact early in the twentieth century, by 1928 only ruins remained, it having been used as a quarry by the local inhabitants. Presenlty, only some remains of walls can be discerned.

When the British conquered the colony in February 1781, they did defend the river mouth, apparently drawing on these earlier Dutch plans. When, one year later, the colony was conquered by the French, they revised the English defense of the river mouth. - At approximately this location, the French built a battery called 'La Reine'.

This is where the VOC-forces landed on Banda Besar in 1621, during the ill-fated first expedition to conquer the island. Still mentioned in the 18th century, at present there are only some remains of the southern and western walls present. These are 60 cm high and 50 cm wide.

After the VOC took over Gorontalo from the kingdom of Ternate in 1681, Fort Leiden was initially its only stone fortification to guard the big and not easily controllable waters around North Sulawesi. The fort was built on the foundations of an earlier Portuguese fort, Ota, dating back to 1527, when Portugal had unsuccessfully tried to control the area. Several other smaller posts in the area consisted of simple earthen walls with a fence of bamboo or wood and a house for the officer (usually a sergeant). It was not until 1764 that the VOC got permission to build an additional stone fort, Nassauw, in Gorontalo, which became the center of their activities in the area. In 1766 fort Leiden was renovated and a lookout tower was built on the hill. The name was changed in fort Leiden. The rectangular fort had two round bastions. Today only the southeast bastion still exists. The original shape of the fort is unknown but the layout with two round bastions could be Portuguese. The walls are between 2 and 3.5 meter high and one meter thick. The fort was the seat of a VOC- appointed resident and a small garrison. Fort Leyden was abandoned at the end of the eighteenth century. In 1818 the Dutch came back. The fort was garrisoned by a sergeant and 12 soldiers, but was once again abandoned in 1832, when the soldiers were relocated to Soelamatta to control the delivery of gold to the government. Today, the fort is a tourist spot. Its present-day name, fort Oranje, cannot be traced to the Dutch period.

In 1599 Wybrand van Warwyck led four ships of the second Dutch fleet ever to reach the Indies, into the bay of Hitu Lama. He and his men were warmly received by local residents, because they hoped the Dutch might help to drive out the Portuguese. The Dutch did take over power from the Portuguese, but had very similar plans to those of their European predecessors, aiming to make most out of the trading opportunities the region had to offer. Van Warwyck felt the need to build a fortress that could protect the Dutch trade interest against the Portuguese competition, as well as possible local uprisings. In the early days of the VOC it became the trading post in this region. The first fort the Dutch built here was a simple enclosure with palisades. Trying to save on personnel costs, the post was abandoned and reinforced several times. In 1642 the post nearly fell in the hands of Makassar troops. This event persuaded the VOC to strengthen the post and keep soldiers stationed here permanently. A stone blockhouse was built within the fort which was first named Enkhuizen and later renamed Fort Leyden. It was guarded by 20 soldiers under the command of a sergeant. Just like other forts in the region –after being occupied by British troops from 1796 until 1817 - it was again put in a state of defence during the uprisings in 1817. After this situation had calmed down again, the troops left the fort and the structure was finally abandoned. After the fort was abandoned, locals started using the stones to build their houses. The site of the blockhouse is now the location of the house of the Hitu Lama village community leaders. Only some ruins of the foundation of the fort can still be seen.

Between Cape Orange and Cape North, the Dutch settled along the Maricary lakes. It is uncertain when the fort was built exactly, but probably around 1620. The Dutch had friendly relations with the indigenous people, like the Arikare, with whom they traded in salted sea cows. It is certain that the fort was destroyed in 1646, by the Portuguese captain major Sebastião Lucena de Azevedo. Lucena was based in Maranhão and in the reconquest of Maranhão in the 1640s, he heard that a Dutchman named Van der Goes was planning on attacking the Portuguese fort on the island of Gurupá, along the shores of the Amazon. Lucena had happened upon Van der Goes during an expedition to the Ilha da Marajó to investigate a shipwreck, and captured him. Upon learning about a planned Dutch attack from his new captive, Lucena then decided to instead to march north to destroy the Dutch fort on the Amapá coast. - Van der Goes was said to have lived in the region for over twenty years. Even though 400 local indigenous people fought for the Dutch, English and French occupants of fort Maricary, the Portuguese proved to be stronger. - In the fort, Lucena found weapons and slaves. Lucena mentioned that the Dutch were able to speak with the local people and that some were even married to local Amerindian women. He concluded that the indigenous inhabitants of the northern region were all too willing to help the other Europeans to establish their presence in the region and showed them where best to build their forts, which all agonised the Portuguese. The fort was the size of a stronghouse and 30 people could live inside it.

In the western part of Tidore, the small native village of Marieko lay on a steep hill on 400 meter from the sea. In 1609 the Spanish fortified the village by building a stone enclosure-wall. They added two bastions with two canons. The fort, which was called Marieco Del Grande, was defended by 14 Spanish soldiers and some Papangers (native soldiers from the Philippines). The fort could only be reached by climbing the 60 degrees steep hill. - Between November 1609 and January 1610 soldiers of the VOC under command of Simon Jansz Hoen unsuccessfully tried to capture the fort on the hill. On February 8 a second attack under command of Governor-General Pieter Both had more success and the fort was taken. The Dutch built a new fort Marieco which was rectangular with four bastions. The names of the bastions were Utrecht, Enkhuizen, Amersfoort and Reaal. A garrison of two companies occupied the fort. In 1616 Willem van Anssing was in charge of the fort. Relatively little is known about its subsequent history. It seems quite likely that the fort fell into decay after the Spanish were forced to leave Tidore. In June 1621 Jan Pietersz Coen ordered the demolition of the fort. - In late 1621 or early 1622 the Spanish reoccupied the fort and started with the rebuilding. The fort was occupied until the final departure of the Spanish from the Moluccas to Manilla in May 1663. - The fort fell into decay. Today the only remains of fort Mareku are parts of the walls on the site of a banana and crop plantation.

In March 1656, about six months after the Indian attack on New Amsterdam, Director General Stuyvesant entered into a peace agreement with the Massapequa Indians, represented by sachem Tackpausha. No further documentary records exist of Fort Massapeag until 13 July 1696, when “ye Indians Land upon Massipeague or ffort Neck at ye south of Oysterbay,” and “ye Old ffort” at “ye Head of ye Meadows on sd. Neck” are mentioned in a deed. A year later the Indian lands here were sold. Excavations conducted in 1934-1935 uncovered various objects and shell middens, suggesting wampum was produced at the location. Further excavations by Ralph S. Solecki revealed “EB” white clay pipe stems, brass mouth harps, copper arrow points, glazed stoneware sherds and other objects that suggest Fort Massapeag confirm dominantly a Contact Period Native American site. No artifacts postdating 1700 were found, suggesting that, consistent with the deed of sale, the site was abandoned after the land was sold in 1697. When the site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993, the Statement of Significance indicated that “The fort's size, shape, and method of construction suggests the fortified trading post and frontier refuge was ordered built by Dutch authorities in 1656.” This suggestion is based on findings by Solecki (see under 'documentation') s, especially on its style (“earthworks quadrangular with two corner bastions [..], surrounded by a six-foot-wide ditch,” size (“only one hundred feet to a side”), and location (low ground, easy access to coastal traffic, entrance facing shore).

In 1612 Governor-General Pieter Both (1610-1614) built a fort near the village of Ngofakiaha in the north of the island. The location of the new fort Mauritius on an 85 meter high hill makes it likely that it was built on the site of an earlier Portuguese or Spanish fort. The fort is square with four bastions of different shapes and sizes. The size of the garrison, commanded by a Lieutenant, depended on the conditions and ranged from 25 to 90 men. Because of the high location it was difficult to bring water, supplies, and trade goods from the beach to the fort. Jacques Le Febvre (Governor of the Moluccas, 1625-1629) therefore built a warehouse on the beach. In 1636 Governor Johan van Broekom (1635-1640) made the small fort Zeeburgh as protection of the water source and the warehouse on the beach. In 1632 a water cellar of 50 leggers (29.1000 liters) was built inside the fort. - The village Ngofakiaha is at the foot of the hill with the fort. In 1655 the VOC made an agreement with the Sultan of Ternate on the destruction of the clove trees on Makian. The enforcement of the treaty made it possible to reduce the number of forts and soldiers. Instead regular hongi-expeditions were made to destroy the young trees. In Ngofiakiah could be chosen between breaking down fort Mauritius or strengthen the warehouse. In 1659, the gentlemen XVII ordered a reduction of the size of the fort to one bastion and the strengthening of Zeeburgh. In 1662 the dilapidated fort was reduced in size. In 1699, the last post holders from the remaining bastion of fort Mauritius were recalled. In 2007 is the ruin of the fort are in the middle of a coconut plantatioon. Its walls and foundations are still clearly recognizable.

The area between the modern Chester and Ridley Creeks at Chester, Pennsylvania, was settled in 1641 and called Upland, presumably after a place of that name in Sweden. According to Johnson, a blockhouse was built on an elevated place here, with Christer Boije in charge. In 1643, Printz reported of Upland and Schylenkyll (Schuylkill): “these two places are now open, yet strong wooden houses are built upon them with small stone-cannon.” Yet five years later, Campanius describes Meconopacka or Upland as “an unfortified place,” although he does add “there was a fort built there some time after it settlement. It is good even land along the river shore.” Acrelius, writing much later, probably bases himself on Campanius when he states that this Swedish settlement was located “upon the river shore, on the same plan, with some houses and a fort.” The exact location of the fortification is unknown and the existence of remains would need to be ascertained.

During the war with Bantam (Banten) in 1656 a pagger (wooden fort) was built on the high bank of the Ciliwong river. The small fort controlled the road to Buitenzorg (Bogor). In 1734, the pagger was replaced by a brick fort. (starfort) - After the outbreak of the Chinese rebellion in september 1740 the High Government sent reinforcements to Mr. Cornelis. In October a Chinese attack on on the fort could be repelled. - In 1746, under Governor General Gustaaf Willem baron van Imhoff (1743-1750) Mr. Cornelis became an encampment to train soldiers in this area with cooler air and less malaria than near the coast. - The pub in the fort became the destination of a popular day trip for inhabitants of Batavia. - In 1810, Governor General Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811) ordered the construction of a large retranchement (reinforced army camp) in Mr. Cornelis. The existing fort was incorporated in the ramparts. Governor General Jan Willem Janssens (1811) could not prevent that the camp was taken by the English on August 26, 1811. - After the return of the Dutch government the fort was redesigned as a military prison. The building subsequently served as a women's prison. It is unknown in what year it was demolished. The prison was closed around 1990. On the modern map the fort is located directly northeast of the bridge over the Ciliwung river in Jakarta Jatinegara, kel. Kampung Melayu 13320.

The first stronghold at Baguala bay was a stone house with a semi-circular gun platform facing the sea, commissioned by Governor Jan van Gorcum in 1626. This blockhouse, named Middelburg, was occupied with four cannon, 21 soldiers and a sergeant. In 1644 and 1674 the complex was severely damaged by earthquakes. Under Governor Robertus Padtbrugge the deteriorated first fort was demolished and in 1686-1688 and replaced by a new blockhouse built on the same foundation. The entrance to the defence work was on the second floor which could be reached by stairs along the west side of the building. This floor was used for living and had six windows. The cannons where placed on the ground floor. Next to the blockhouse, Padtbrugge also took the initiative of digging a canal connecting the Bay of Ambon and the Bay of Baguala. Under Bernardus van Pleuren (Governor of Ambon, 1777-1785) the fort was renovated and changed according to the design of engineer Hans Ernst von Wagner. However, soon after, during the English occupation, the fort was neglected and fell into ruin. Remains of the fort are still visible. Parts of the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern walls are still standing. These walls are composed of red bricks, finished with natural stone. The ruin is located in the periphery of Ambon city, surrounded by densely people's dwellings. Because the sedimentation process, today the fort stands 250 meters from the sea.

The Europeans were a minority of the population inside the walled city of Batavia. Many inhabitants were slaves and there was always the possibility of an uprising against their masters. In 1653 an important delegation of Mataram visited the government of the VOC in the castle. The presence of so many Javanese inside the city walls caused a feeling of unsafety amongst the Governor General and his counsellors. Nothing happened, but the gentlemen decided to take precautions against an uprising. In the centre of the city south west of the bridge over the Kali Besar a redoubt was built. In the fort there was one sergeant, two or three corporals and 20 soldiers. The eight guns on the second floor of this small fortification, which was called “Het Middelpunt” (The Middle Point), controlled the roads and the river. The only time these guns were used, was during the Chinese Massacre in 1740, when they fired at the houses of the Chinese west of Kali Besar. The fort was demolished by Governor general Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1911). Today the location of the fort is under Kali Besar Barat south of the crossing with Jalan Kopi. There are no visible remains of redoubt Middelpunt.

In early 1664, director general and council resolved to send a scouting party to the banks of the Navesink River, just south of Sandy Hook, in order to choose a proper place for a redoubt or blockhouse (een reduijt or houten wambuijs). Their action was a response to rumours that English settlers from Gravesend were about to purchase land there, even though it had already been bought a month earlier by representatives of the Dutch colonial government. Director general and council intended to place a small garrison at Navesink as well. Considering the developments in New Netherland later in 1664, it is unlikely that these plans ever came to fruition.

In an attempt to put its fur trade on a secure footing, the New Netherland Company in 1614 established “a redoubt or small fort [..] with a small garrison” on the Hudson River. The Fort of Nassau is wide 58 feet square within the walls, the moat is 18 feet wide. [..] The house was 36 feet long and 26 wide in the fort. Even though the accuracy of De Laet's description is subject to doubt, the reference to “the form of a redoubt,” “walls,” and a “moat of eighteen feet wide” suggest that the outer works of Fort Nassau consisted of earthworks of a simple shape, without protruding points or bastions. There is no reference to a palisade or stockade and while that should not be interpreted as proof of its absence, it makes it unlikely that the perimeter defence of Fort Nassau consisted of a vertical wooden structure, as has been proposed by Len Tantillo. Assuming that the moat (gracht) was filled with water and was not a dry moat or ditch (greppel), a direct connection to the Hudson River is a conceivable option. In that case, it is likely that Fort Nassau was constructed on the bank of the river and that the side facing the river remained exposed, especially if the two cast guns were located in a position that allowed a clear field of fire over the river. The proximity to the river made Fort Nassau vulnerable to flooding. Van Wassenaer does not specify in which year Fort Nassau was abandoned, but Moulton asserted that it happened in 1617, while O'Callaghan preferred 1618 probably on the basis of Stuyvesant's letter of 1660, referred to below. There is no convincing documentary evidence for either suggestion, even though both years are frequently referred to in popular historiography and on websites. \tIf the precise chronology of Fort Nassau is uncertain, so is its location. Fort Nassau was constructed on Castle Island (Casteels Eyland) but the exact location is difficult to pinpoint, as the evidence is contradictory. On the 1614 map of New Netherland, a small mark in the middle of the island may indicate its location, but on a later Vingboons map a larger mark can be discerned on the north point of the island. Yet on the ca. 1632 “Gillis van Scheyndel Map” a farmhouse (Welysburg) is located on the north point. These discrepancies are probably due to inaccuracies in cartography as well as to changes in the island's topography as frequent flooding caused erosion and sedimentation. A flood in April 1640 covered Castle Island with water four feet deep, as the river rose to twelve feet higher than its regular level. The floods that severely damaged Fort Orange in 1647/1648 and 1666 very likely also hit Castle Island. \tWhile remnants of the fort were still discernible in 1680, it is likely that flood erosion gradually removed them. On May 22, 1833, the New York Evening Post carried an article about a devastating flood of what was then called Patroon's Island. The flood “swept every vestige of vegetation of its surface” and “the entire surface of the soil is washed away to the depth of several feet.” The newspaper reported that “Human skeletons, buried after the Indian manner, in a sitting posture, have been exposed” by the flood, but there is no reference to any remains of Fort Nassau. This omission increases the likeliness that at this point in time, almost 220 years after its construction, few if any traces of Fort Nassau remained. \t\t\t\t\t\t  On the basis of documentary evidence then, it is impossible to locate Fort Nassau with certainty on either the middle section or the north end of Castle Island. This makes it difficult to determine where to start an archaeological investigation, which may not even yield a result. Apart from earlier floods, the 1833 flood, purportedly removing a considerable portion of the topsoil, may also have washed away the sub-surface remainders of the fort, with the possible exceptions of a stone or brick foundation of the dwelling house and the traces of a dugout moat or well. Even if an excavation turned up such traces on Castle Island, it may well be impossible to determine whether they pertain to Fort Nassau from the 1610s or to the farm from the 1630s. In sum, the subsequent development of Westerlo Island, as it was called in the nineteenth century, into an airfield and, later on, the Port of Albany-Rensselaer, as well as the filling in of Island Creek and the construction of a railroad make it unlikely that the exact location of Fort Nassau will ever be established or that remains will be uncovered.

In early 1609, building was started on the forts on Bandaneira, after the VOC had resolved to build forts on the Banda Islands to maintain control over the spice trade, on which the VOC claimed a monopoly. Fort Nassau was built on the remains of an earlier fort that the Portuguese had had on Bandaneira. It was a rectangular stone fort, with angled bastions on each corner. Some years later a mote was dug around the fort. In the 18th century a hornwork was added on the seaside. Fort Nassau, situated on the seaside, was the administrative headquarters of Bandaneira. The fort was initially vulnerable from the land side: for this reason a small redoubt was erected on the hill behind the fort in 1611. In the course of the 17th century, this redoubt was expanded to become Fort Belgica. Nassau came to be known as the water fort. Nowadays the western, southern and eastern walls as well as the bastions on the southern side still remain. The northern wall and the two northern bastions were torn down in 1896. In that same period, the mote was filled up and bricks and stones from the fort were used as building materials. Until 2018, the fort was largely overgrown and dilapidated. Since then, however, extensive restorations have taken place.

Francois Wittert, vice-admiral of the VOC, built this a fort on the northeast coast of Moti Island in 1609, on request of the Ternate people. Captain Adriaan Clemensz. Stok became the first commandant of fort Nassau. In1610 captain Apollonius Schot was in charge of the garrison of 80 soldiers. In the village near the fort lived about 2000 people. Two years later the garrison was reduced to 40 soldiers. - The fort with three bastions was made of coral stone and stone. It had 10 cannon, with enough cannonballs and 14 half barrels of gunpowder. In 1616 captain Hendrick Mayer of Maastricht became commander of the fort. - In 1625 the governor of the Moluccas Jacques Lefebvre ordered Geen Huigen Schaepenham to demolish fort Nassau. The Spanish who then came to the island felt it unnecessary to reuse the fort. - At present the fort has mostly collapsed due to sea water abrasion and also due to local peoples using its stones as building materials. Some of the ruins are in the sea and some are scattered along the coast.

On 13 June 1654, when an English attack on New Amsterdam seemed imminent, director general and council decided that in addition to strengthening other fortifications, “the City Tavern is to be ensconced with a small rampart and breastworks, upon which 2 or 3 light artillery pieces are to be placed.” As news of the Treaty of Westminster, agreed upon in Europe on 15 April 1654, reached New Amsterdam on June 16, it is not likely that plans for such a fortification were implemented straightaway. The Castello Plan shows only five trees and two fences at the location, although that may be the result of Vingboons adding detail to the original map that was sent over. The 1661 English description of New Amsterdam, however, mentions “the Stat-house, before wch is built a half moon of stone, where are mounted 3 smal bras guns, tho it be large enough to mount 8 guns on it.” In 1671, a fortification was still in place at this location, as one of the magistrates was charged to supervise “the Managemt in Repairing of the half moon before the state house.” The construction is depicted on the so-called Labadist General View of circa 1679. Presumably the last remnants were removed once landfill and new buildings obstructed the line of sight to the East River and made a fortification at this location obsolete.

The meeting decided “to fence off the greater part of the city with an upright stockade and a small breastwork, so as to be able to draw all inhabitants behind it in time of need and defend as much as possible their persons and goods against an attack.” A joint committee was set up to supervise the work. A month later, director general and council, upon hearing new rumours from New England, in a joint meeting with the city government decided to add a ditch to the defence works on the northern edge of the city. It is sometimes asserted that enslaved Africans built the wall , but they formed only a part of the labour force. All inhabitants were called upon to dig a moat or a canal (graft) from the East River to the North River, which was to be four to five feet deep and eleven to twelve feet wide, sloping inward slightly toward the bottom. At the same time, the carpenters were urged to complete the work on the palisade. By early July, the palisade had been completed both along the northern edge as well as along the Strand at the East River. The city gate at the side of the East River was very likely also constructed at this time. - New measures to improve the city's defences were agreed upon only when the Indian attack of 15 September 1655 instilled urgency into the city fathers. On 20 September 1655, the city government determined “that the aforesaid erected works shall be heightened with planks of five to six [feet] high, nailed horizontally to the side of the palisade.” In collaboration with director general and council, burgomasters and schepenen decided upon a 'voluntary' subscription, for which purpose all inhabitants of the city were assessed. - In 1656, Stuyvesant again needed to remind the city government of its duty to keep the defences in good order. Mindful of the situation in the Dutch Republic, the burgomasters and schepenen replied that the burden of fortifying a “frontier place” (<frontierplaetse>) like New Amsterdam should not exclusively be born by the city's inhabitants. In their view, the costs should be defrayed from the general revenue (gemeene lants middelen). Despite continuing discussions like these, some additional work was done to strengthen the outer defences. This included a prohibition to build houses within a cannon shot from the city walls as well as the planned construction of new defence works consisting of a double row of palisades, with two or three openings which could be closed by night, both for reasons of security and to prevent smuggling. Yet the plans put forward by Stuyvesant in the same month suggest further improvements were required. The director general desired further repairs with sods to the palisades as well as the construction of a forward star-shaped sconce at Maiden Lane. Both corners at the North and East River were to be fortified with a hornwork of horizontally positioned logs. The elevations on the shore of the North River, which could provide shelter to landing forces, had to be levelled and a proper palisade erected. Stuyvesant wanted a battery on the north side of the city as well as on the little cape (t Capsken) at the south point. As funds were scarce and the need arguable, it is unlikely that any start was made to execute these plans. - By early 1664, the need to improve fortifications was much more urgent. The New Amsterdam city government suggested building a stone wall (steene muer) strengthening the East River city gate with a bulwark (bolwerck), and erecting a closed palisade (dichte geslooten palissaden) along the East River from the city gate down to the roundel (rondeel) in front of the City Hall. Down to the little cape another palisade would provide protection, while the cape itself required a water fort (water fort). Along the North River palisades were also required to prevent enemy forces from landing. Through a loan on its citizens, New Amsterdam was able to raise a total of ƒ 27,500. Making use of the labour of West India Company soldiers (who were required to do guard duty only one day out of three), the city government very likely made some progress over the summer. As it was, the improved fortifications were not put to the test when the English frigates arrived later that year.

On the location of the Spanish fort San Salvador, the VOC built the fort Noord-Holland in 1642. In 1662, during the invasion of the Chinese warlord Koxinga, the fort was evacuated and demolished. In 1664 the location was reoccupied. On the foundations of the old fortification a new one was built, which was known as fort Nassau, or, slightly less formally, the Zeepunt (sea point). This fort was abandoned in 1668, when the VOC definitively withdrew from Taiwan. - The fort was supported by various redoubts, the most important of which was the redoubt Victoria, later also known as the Pockel.

The Dutch constructed a small fortification on the northern coast of the island to control the access. They built this fort in 1633 when they launched their final assault on N.S. da Conceição. De Laet wrote that the troops landed in June 1633 on the northern side of the island where Captain Everwijn was lodged in a small redoubt on the beach; they inspected the hill where the Portuguese had made a small fortification in 1632 and decided to construct the redoubt on the hill (Laet 1934: 163). Later that year garrisoned 21 soldiers were garrisoned there (Laet 1934: 208). The fort was probably abandoned in 1646 because the map from 1648 shows a place that is described in the legend as the place where the north tower once was (NL-HaNA_4.VEL_707). Today the fort is called Fortim da Ponta de Catuama and its remains have been located by researchers from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) (Barretto 2010: 84)

The design of the fort, which had four earthen bastions and was armed with eight guns, was probably made by surveyor Johannes Listingh. The garrison prevented the stealing of cattle, which grazed on the <Paviljoensveld> near of the fort. It also guarded the sluice, which divided the water between the river Ciliwung and the Nieuwe Vaart - Molenvliet. - In 1697 the guns were removed from the fort. During the Chinese Revolt of 1740 the guards burned the buildings and the soldiers left the isolated fort. In 1741 they came back and repaired the damage. In 1770 seven soldiers lived in the fort and took care of the operation of the sluice. Fort Noordwijk was demolished by Governor general Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811). - On a modern map of Jakarta Fort Noordwijk would have been situated southeast of station Juanda, between the railroad and the crossing of Jalan Pintu Air and Jalan Pos. There are no visible traces left of the fort, but the sluice (Pintu Air) is still in use.

The Portuguese in the town of Nossa Senhora da Conceição, surrounded by the Dutch troops and cut off from outside help, were forced to surrender in 1633. Another anonymous map shows positions of the Dutch and the lay out of the town and the surrounding countryside. Note the quarters of father and son Tourlon on the rear side of the city on the map in image 14.The city was renamed Schoppestad in honour of Lieutenant-General Sigismund van Schoppe. The Dutch built a wall around the church and closed the rear side of the city; they also made a small fortification, like a watch tower to the north. - The town was attacked by the Portuguese on 18 June 1646 and nearly conquered (Hulsman 2014b: 8). The Dutch then decided to abandon the fortification and concentrate their forces in Fort Orange. The retreat was hampered by rumours of treason in Fort Orange, so that most of the cannon were broken and thrown down from the hill. The decision was apparently reversed because a map from 1648 shows two redoubts. There 12 cannon were rendered when the Dutch surrendered the town in 1654. The Dutch defences in this period constitute an as yet undefined multiple object.

In 1643, Johan Printz moved the capital of New Sweden to Tinicum Island, higher up on the Delaware River, where he built his manor house, called Printzhof. Nearby, on a high point facing the river, Fort Nya Gothenborgh was constructed of “hemlock beams, laid one upon the other,” armed with four small brass cannon, and garrisoned with eight soldiers and two gunners. It is presumed that the storehouse was located on the land side of the island A year later, Printz said of 'Tinnakongh', as the island was often called, that, like Fort Christina, it was “also in like manner made so strong that those who are therein need not fear for any savages, even if they were several thousands.” But a different enemy took Printz at unawares. According to Printz, a fire was started through the carelessness of one of the gunners, destroying the fortress. He had the fort rebuilt the next year. Few details are available on Fort Nya Gothenborgh after it was rebuilt. When the Dutch conquered New Sweden some plundering took place on the island, but whether this affected the fort is uncertain. The Company directors renamed the island “Cattenburch,” after one of the islands in the recent extension of their city. The name did not stick, and in the documents after 1655 the island Tinicum is mentioned at times, without however any reference to a fort.

The relations between the Swedes and the Dutch shifted from uneasy coexistence to outright rivalry when both nations decided to focus on the Schuylkill River and built fortifications there in proximity to each other. Presumably the building materials consisted of the “large quantities of pine logs,” which had been lying in the Schuylkill throughout the winter. A similar building method had been used for Fort Nya Gothenborgh (see above). In April 1648 Hudde was informed by Native American sachems that the Swedes had already built several buildings on the Schuylkill. As they invited him to do likewise, he quickly contacted Stuyvesant in New Amsterdam. After obtaining permission Hudde proceeded to build a Dutch fortification, called Fort Beversreede, next to the Swedish Fort Nya Korsholm that had been built in 1647. An exchange of protests with the Swedish commander lieutenant Måns Nilsson Kling ensued, but nevertheless Hudde pushed on with the work. He surrounded the house with palisades (palisaden) against Swedish attempts to destroy it, as they had done with a previous West India Company house downstream. Hudde adds: “I have erected a fort so that he might not also come here to do the same.” Later in 1648 the Swedes “built a house in front of Fort Beversreede, whereby the entrance to this fort was virtually closed off.” Later that autumn, one of the Swedes at night “to deride us pulled the palisades of Fort Beversreede apart and broke through them,” which suggests that the fortification was not as sturdy as Hudde would have liked. Fort Beversreede was abandoned when the Dutch built Fort Casimir. Johnson assumes that Fort Nya Korsholm was also abandoned in 1651, at the same time as Fort Nya Elfsborg. As the concentration of Swedish forces was a likely reaction to the building of Fort Casimir by the Dutch, Johnson's suggestion seems quite plausible. Native Americans burned down the abandoned Fort Nya Korsholm a few years later.

In the early 1640s, the Swedes built a blockhouse on a tributary to Darby Creek, which empties into the Delaware River. Its presumed location is in Philadelphia's Kingsessing neighbourhood, near Cobbs Creek Parkway and Greenway Avenue. According to a report by Andries Hudde compiled in 1647 or, most likely, 1648, Nya Vasa must have been in existence earlier. In 1643, Printz reported of Upland and Schylenkyll (Schuylkill): “these two places are now open, yet strong wooden houses are built upon them with small stone-cannon.” Myers asserts that this “evidently” refers to “Wasa, or Nya Wasa, at Kingsessing.” He may well be right, although the first use of that name for the location comes from Acrelius, writing over a century later. According to Acrelius, this place, and some others, “which are marked upon the oldest maps, were places laid out and planned, but did not get established under the Swedish administration.” Despite this confusion, it is clear that a fortified house, later called Nya Vasa, was built in the early 1640s.

Little is known about the fort Hectoria at the village of Oma. The redoubtwas located at the coastal area surrounded by nutmeg and clove plantations. Initially in 1627 it was a wooden fort guarded by ten soldiers and one sergeant. From April till July 1636 the small stronghold was besieged by rebels under the command of Leliato. In 1644 it was heavily damaged by an earthquake. Because the position of the fort was hard to defend, with mountains surrounding it, and lack of fresh water, in 1656 the fort was demolished, in favour of a new fort at Haruku. Today only the stone foundation remain on top of which recently a house has been built.

From 1614 onwards, so even before the founding of Batavia, Onrust island was used as a shipyard for maintenance to VOC vessels. During the siege of the Dutch lodge in Jayakarta in 1618-1619 Jan Pietersz Coen first proposed to build a fort on the island, but this plan was abandoned because of the lack of fresh water on the island. During the war with Bantam (Banten) (1655-1656) surveyor Johannes Listingh made a simple fortification to protect he ship yard against a surprise attack. He connected the existing buildings with a wall and added two diagonal bastions. The amount of work increased and new buildings, sawmills and even a church were added. The fortification was too small and in 1671 the design was made of a big fort with five bastions. The work started with the construction by the contractors Jan Boulan and Dionys Kelck of the stone north west bastion or Grote Battery (Big Battery) (1672-1674). The walls of the workshops were at the same time the northern curtain of the fort. In 1679 there were growing tensions between the VOC and Bantam. Governor General Rijkloff van Goens (1678-1681) ordered to close the undefended part of the fort with a palisade. In 1685 a powder house for 200.000 pound of powder was built inside the big bastion. The south west and south east bastion were built in wood (1689/1691). After 1750 the palisade was replaced by stone walls and the bastions Touwpunt and Beeckhuys and a fence. In 1795 the Dutch demolished the fort and the main part of the buildings on Onrust. In 1800 the British burned down the remaining buildings. Between 1980 and 1995 archaeological research was done on Onrust. Today the island is a protected monument. The historic park with the buildings of the quarantine station, foundation of the VOC fort, graveyard and museum attracts many visitors from Jakarta.

In the treaty between the VOC and the susuhunan after the Chinese War (1740-1743) it was decided that three forts would be built to control the strategic road between Semarang and Jogyakarta. The cost of the construction was paid by the susuhunan. \t Fort De Ontmoeting (Encounter) was probably built after the signing of the Treaty of Giyanti (1757), in which Mataram was divided between the susuhunan in Yogyakarta and the sunan in Surakarta. The name of the fort reminded of the historical encounter (Dutch: Ontmoeting) between Sunan Pakubuwono II and governor general Gustaaf Willem Baron van Imhoff on May 11, 1746. It is possible that there was a temporary fort, because the gable stone of the existing stone fort mentions the year 1786. During the renovation of the latter year, the fort got its current square form with four half-bastions. In 1811 a British invasion army landed near Batavia and beat the Dutch-French Army. Fort De Ontmoeting was taken soon after. In 1817 the Dutch were back and laid a garrison of 25 men in the fort. De Ontmoeting lost much of its significance after the construction of the large fort Willem I in Ambarawa (1837-1844). From 1840 until 1908 the fort was mainly used to take care of sick soldiers, because of the healthy mountainous environment. From 1865 it no longer served a defensive function. From 1919 to 1942 the fort was probably empty. It was subsequently used by the Japanese army, Indonesian nationalist troops, the Dutch military police, the Indonesian army and as residences of the Indonesian police and their families. From 2008 it stood empty; in 2011 it was entirely renovated.

After a few years of intermittent and itinerant trade by private merchants, the West India Company assumed control of New Netherland. One of its first measures was to send over a group of colonists, which upon arrival was divided over four locations. A 1626 description by Van Wassenaer (see documentation) establishes the shape of Fort Orange, i.e. a four-pointed European style fort, but its size remains unspecified in the early sources. Research by Paul Huey (see under documentation) indicates that the rectangular interior area of the fort measured almost fifty meters, while the outside dimensions were less than 55 meters from north to south. - For the 1630s, sources on Fort Orange are scarce. On the ca. 1632 “Gillis van Scheyndel Map” of Rensselaerswijck (New York State Library, not currently included in this database) , Fort Orange is indicated by a four-pointed enclosure, surrounded by what appears to be a moat or a ditch. It is likely that during the 1630s and 1640s Fort Orange's earthworks, even though the points were reinforced with wooden stakes, suffered the same kind of erosion as those of Fort Amsterdam. French Jesuit Isaac Jogues's remarks that the fort was “basty de pieux” was translated by Thwaites as “built of logs.”(Thwaites 261-262 - see under documentation) It is conceivable that the curtains of Fort Orange were built vertically, in the form of palisades, while the points were constructed with horizontal beams. - Even though Jogues considered Fort Orange to be “small,” it was still large enough to contain several buildings. The small houses on the site were most likely the lodgings of the common soldiers, with the larger house providing accommodation for the higher officials. Other measures taken in 1648 reveal more details of Fort Orange, for instance that it was surrounded by “a dry moat.” The plan for repairing the fort included surrounding “it with a wall of stone, instead of timber, so as to avoid the annual expense and repairs.” A start had already been made with by quarrying local stone, but the extent to which the plan was put into effect remains uncertain. - During the First Anglo-Dutch War the directors in Amsterdam were concerned about the defensive condition of New Netherland. At the very least, the walls of Fort Orange protected the building inside the fort against high water. During the 1650s a new guardhouse and a courthouse were built, both in brick, and at considerable expense. The courthouse was a strong and substantial house, founded upon two cellars with a stone foundation. The first story was divided into three spaces, including a kitchen of 16 by 21 feet. The upper level was divided into two rooms, the courtroom and an office, each 21 feet square. - By June 1660, just after hostilities with the Esopus Indians had erupted again, Fort Orange was considered beyond repair. The bad state of the fort brought the West India Company in disrepute, La Montagne reported indignantly, as it reflected upon his person as well. The courts of Beverwijck and Rensselaerswijck together with La Montagne had decided to let the old houses stand for the time being and focus on “repairing the bastions at the least expenses and with the greatest speed.” In 1664, when New Netherland was taken over by the English, Fort Orange was renamed Fort Albany. During the brief Dutch reconquest of 1673-1674, its name was Fort Nassau (not te be confused with the earlier fort Nassau slightly downriver on what used to be Castle Island). Despite the continuing efforts to repair it, in 1675 the fort was in such a bad condition that the English governor Edmund Andros decided to abandon it and build a new fort, later named Fort Frederick, on the hill (now Capitol Hill) overlooking the town and further away from the river.

From this fort, the Dutch traded sugar and tobacco with the local population. It was probably founded in one of the earliest expeditions of the Zeelanders on the Amazon around 1600, but had been destroyed before the Dutch returned to the fort in 1615. Then, it was reconstructed with a gate. In 1623, the Portuguese attacked the fort and conquered it, finding 14 Dutchmen defending the fort and some Angolan and Indian slaves, tobacco, cotton and weapons. - The location of the fort is not exactly known, but the name Materu on the left side of VEL0684 likely indicates its location.

The fort was designed by engineer Van Buren and at the time of construction was square and had four bulwarks on the corners measuring along the outer bulwarks 132 roeden. Apparently the Dutch constructed a small redoubt to protect the workers (see image 3). In the middle of June 1631 a hornwork was constructed and the fort was ready by the end of the month. - Part of the building material came from a small island to the north that was stripped of its vegetation. Some 400 people were living in the fort. The report of Richshoffer in October 1631 indicates that construction works continued, the soldiers were probably constantly trying to dig out the moat that was receiving sand that came in with the sea. The fort was adapted when it was attacked in 1632. The wall was raised four and a half feet on the northwestern side and some trenches were also made in case of an attack. These works were probably made with sand from the beach. The garrison was probably diminished, but there is no information until 1638 when the fort is reported to be square with four bulwarks and having been repaired recently. But it was completely without a moat and was lacking palisades, which would have to be made. The moat was to be dug out and a contra-escarpe was to be built on the outside. North of the fort there was a hornwork. - Apparently all the bulwarks had been closed at the time that the drawing shown in image 5 was made. There is shown a moat and a hornwork, but it is not known if this drawing was a representation of an actual situation or a plan. The report of 1640 described the Fort also as a square fortress with four bastions. It mentioned that the bastions were constructed reasonably high. It also referred to the problematic moat that was only partly in place and was described as being shallow and dry. The fort was now surrounded by a strong pilework. The garrison of the fortress at the time was composed of a total complement of 182 soldiers. - The garrison of Fort Orange in August 1643 had been reduced to only 71 soldiers, the economic crisis in Dutch Brazil forced the WIC to take drastic measures. The lack of finances meant that there probably was no money to undertake repairs to the fort. The artist Frans Post produced several images of the island of Itamaracá, but no detailed image of the fort by his hand was published. The unpublished image that Post produced of Fort Orange was probably the basis for images that were published later, like the one shown in image 6. On one of these images the Fort is depicted in detail and there are several aspects that seem quite different from the ground plan reproduced as image 5. The position of the latrine does not match that of the ground plan and it seems that the eastern bulwark is lacking.The gate built of brick masonry that Nieuhof mentioned, is clearly visible on the sea-side according to the ground plan of image 5. The large square building with the flag is difficult to place on the ground plan. It is difficult to determine to what extent this image represents the actual situation of the Fort at the time (image 6). - The last detailed description that was consulted dates from 1646 and described the fort as having a solid wall and a parapet all around made of wood. At the time there were no palisades, but their construction had already been contracted. The moat continued to be shallow. The hornwork was partly demolished. The interior had a powder house that was in a reasonable state and there were living quarters. - This report also mentioned the gate as being vaulted with masonry. The garrison had probably had been increased, but its exact strength is difficult to calculate as there are no specific lists for the Fort, but only for the island as a whole. It is reasonable though that some 200-250 soldiers out of the total of approximately 470 on the whole of Itamaracá, stayed at Fort Orange.

Sultan Said became a prisoner but his kin asked the help of the VOC. In 1607, Admiral Cornelis Matelieff tried in vain to expel the Spaniards. The Dutch built fort Melayu on the East coast, carving out their own sphere of influence on the island to rival that of the Spanish. In 1609 the name was changed to Castle Orange. - Between from 1611 and the move to Batavia (Jakarta) in 1619 Castle Orange was administrative center of the Dutch East India Company in Asia and the seat of the Governor General, After 1619 it was the seat of the Governor of the Moluccas. - Until the peace of 1648, the two areas into which Ternate was divided existed in constant hostility. After the Spaniards left the Moluccas in 1663, plans were made to reduce the fort, but in practice only small were made. The new building in 1757 was necessary due to the poor state of the buildings. In 1791 the Military State Commission inspected the fort, but the designs of engineer C.F. Reimer were never executed. - In 1795, war broke out between the Netherlands (which at that time became a satellite state of revolutionary France) and England. In 1801 the English laid siege to fort Orange After five months Governor Willem Jacob Cransen capitulated. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802 the Moluccas were returned to the Dutch, but the following year war broke again. In 1810 the fort capitulated after a short shelling and the Moluccas came under English administration. In 1817 the Dutch returned. - The 19th century was a time of decline for the Moluccas. In 1840 the city of Ternate and Castle Oranje were damaged by an earthquake. damage. In the years 1870-1874 several building works were executed. In 1916 the land wall with its bastions was demolished. Till the end of the 20th century Castle Orange was used by the army and the police. Between 1980 and 2015 several restoration projects were established by the Indonesian Government. Castle Orange now serves as public space and a Spice Museum.

In 1628 the VOC built a wooden lodge at Luhu, which was an important collection centre and a major site for the cultivation of cloves. This first lodge was destroyed by fire. To replace the burnt lodge, in 1631 a stone house was built by Lieutenant Walraven and 40 men slightly further inland. Because it was hard to get enough drinking water at this location, not long after governor Artus Gijsels (1631–1634) decided to again move the stronghold at Luhu back to a river mouth at the coast. The new fort was named De Bullebak. Also this fort was short-lived, because Governor Antoni van den Heuvel (1634-1635) decided to dismantle it. The people of Luhu felt very unsafe without the VOC protection and requested a new fort to be built. Commissioned by Governor Johan Ottens (1637-1641) a new lodge and a blockhouse were constructed and in 1644 governor Gerard Demmer (1642–1647) finally built a stone redoubt which would last. Until the war in 1651 it was one of the most important posts and strongest fortification structures of the government of Ambon. It consisted of a blockhouse surrounded by a stone ramparts with two bastions. With their presence the VOC aimed to trade cloves and prevent what it considered illegal cultivation and smuggling of cloves. In various occasions this let to struggles with the local population. During a 1651-1656 war the VOC deported the local population and destroyed the forests on the peninsula so no more cloves could be grown. In 1697 the government of Ambon decided to abandon forts in villages where were no VOC offices, but an exception was made for Fort Overburg. In the nineteenth century the fort was used several times to control uprisings. Troops left the fort for the very last time in 1862. Since then the fort has deteriorated. After a fire in 1897 burned down the fort and most of houses in the village, the local population used the structure for building materials to rebuild the village. As a consequence, only parts of the southwest bastion and some walls and foundation are still visible today.

Establishing a fort on the north shore of Long Island would create a Dutch military presence at the boundary between New Netherland and New England as determined at the Hartford Treaty in 1650. Director general and council first suggested a fort on Long Island in a letter to the Amsterdam directors during the First Anglo-Dutch War. In reply, the directors agreed with the plan “to erect a small fort or even only a small redoubt or blockhouse on Long Island.” The Peace of Westminster did not take away the urgency, on the contrary. In early 1655, New Netherland authorities had to act against English encroachments west of the boundary line. Yet subsequent plans for a fort at Oyster Bay, the location of choice, were slow to materialize, because it required extensive consultations between the authorities in New Amsterdam and their superiors in patria. In April and May 1655, the Amsterdam directors instructed director general and council again “to determine our boundaries by the erection of a fort, wherever you thought best and most convenient.” For this purpose, they sent to New Amsterdam “a consignment of goods which you will find necessary to make a fort.” Unfortunately, the specification of these goods is not extant. Subsequent references make it doubtful whether they were sent at all. In September 1657, the Amsterdam directors indicated that the financial situation of the Amsterdam chamber was such that they could not support the plans. Any funds would have to be supplied by the West India Company authorities in New Netherland, even though the Amsterdam directors agreed “that erecting a wooden fort or small fortress [would] serve to determine our limits on the extreme boundaries against those of New England.” \tContinued wrangling with the English colonists about the interpretation of the stipulations of the Hartford Treaty prevented progress being made. In early 1659 the Amsterdam directors ordered Stuyvesant to proceed “with the erecting of the aforementioned wooden fort on the extreme boundaries and on the Oyster Bay.” Stuyvesant and his councillors objected to this: they pointed out that the difference of opinion about the exact location of the place called Oyster Bay in the Hartford Treaty was at the root of the problem. Before building “a fortress or a wooden fort,” this issue needed to be resolved. Director general and council warned that using the location suggested by the directors would mean that the English town of Huntington would fall under Dutch jurisdiction. In their opinion, this would meet with immediate opposition and thus cause further complications. They kept on delaying into 1660, arguing that they lacked “the necessary means, especially carpenters [to build] a redoubt or wooden fort at the Oyster Bay.” In addition, director general and council expressed doubt as to whether erecting a fort would actually achieve the aim of stopping English encroachments and preventing smuggling. A well-equipped yacht might be better, they thought. \tThe directors grew impatient and became annoyed with what they considered procrastination in New Amsterdam. In their opinion, employing a yacht was too expensive and there was no need to wait for carpenters to arrive from the Dutch Republic as other fortifications and buildings inside forts had also been constructed without them. By this time the directors had also given up hope of obtaining approval of the Hartford Treaty by the new English government. Director general and council used this information to further delay the building of a fort at Oyster Bay. In July 1661, they reported they had postponed the construction of the fort, as they awaited the result of Anglo-Dutch negotiations in Europe. By this time the Amsterdam directors were really getting angry. In their reply of 27 January 1662, they pointed out that while they had informed New Amsterdam of the Anglo-Dutch negotiations, they had not countermanded their previous order. Director general and council thus ought to have proceeded with building of this fort, as well as others. It is quite possible that in reaction to this final order, a fort was in fact constructed at Oyster Bay, although the records do not provide a definite answer and no remains have been located.

Fort Pentagouet was a fortification, built in 1625 in Castine, Maine, which served as the capital of the French colony of Acadia. A map of ca. 1670 depicts it as a standard four-pointed fort, located in the Penobscot River estuary, along the coast, near the confluence of the Bagaduce River and the Penobscot River. In 1674, Jurriaen Aernoutsz, captain of the frigate Vliegende Paert van Curacao, attacked the fort. As the garrison consisted of just thirty men, they quickly surrendered. Aernoutsz sailed on to Fort Jemseg, a trading post located on the east bank of the Jemseg River in what now is New Brunswick, and also captured that fort. Returning south, Aernoutsz sold the guns (tout le canon) of Fort Pentagouet in Boston to governor John Leverett of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Before interested parties from New York, such as Cornelis Steenwijck and John Rhoade, could enforce the Dutch claim, the English briefly took possession before the area returned to French rule. Most of the documents related to the Dutch attack on Acadia deal with the aftermath and contain little detail about the capture of Fort Pentagouet and Fort Jemseg or of the material condition of the fortifications. It is clear however that the activities of the Dutch forces during their brief stay were mostly of a destructive nature.

He chose kampong Baru on 54 kilometres of Batavia and about 300 meters above sea level. Van Imhoff called his estate Buitenzorg (present-day Bogor) His heirs sold the estate to his successor. Governor General Jacob Mossel (1750-1761). It became the practice that a new governor bought the palace from his predecessor. In the 19th century the estate was bought by the government to use it as palace of the Governor General. Today the building is the palace of the president of the Republic Indonesia. - In 1752 rebels, who were chased by the VOC from the sultanate Bantam (Banten) ransacked the area of Buitenzorg. Governor General Mossel ordered the construction of the small fort Philippine opposite the palace to protect his estate against robbers. It was called after his daughter Philippina Theodora Mossel (1731-1765). Inside the octagonal wall of the fort stood a guardhouse with a small bell tower. Fort Philippina was demolished by Governor General Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811), who wanted to build a larger palace on the site. There are no remains of the fort.

Kraton (palace) Pleret was built to fulfill the wish of Susuhunan Amangkurat I (1646-1677), who did not want to stay at his late father's (Sultan Agung, 1613-1646) former palace. Amangkurat I moved his new palace Purarya (Pleret) in 1647. The construction of the enclosure-wall was finished in two months. The fortified wall was made from bricks inserted with natural stones, the upper part of the wall had the shape of a triangular made from white blocks. The size of the walled area was circa 640 x 540 m (circa 345,600 m 2). The wall was five till six meter high and 1,5 m thick. To gates gave entrance to the craton. In 1674 prince Trunanjaya revolted against Amangkurat I, who was forced to flee from his craton Pleret was ransacked The Sunan's two sons also joined their father. The second son, prince Puger, succeeded to regain Pleret. He crowned himself as King of Mataram. The result was a war with his elder brother Anom (Sunan Amangkurat II) in Kartasura, who with support of the VOC defeated Puger. Kartasura became the capital of the kingdom Mataram. Craton Plered was abandoned. During the Dipponegoro War (1825-1830) the enclosure wall of the craton was still standing. In 1826 followers of the prince occupied the kraton, but they fled after the Dutch East Indian army stormed the wall. At the end ow the 19th century the wall was demolished and the bricks were used to build the local sugar factory. Today there are no more remains of the wall visible. Since 1978 archaeologists have excavated parts of the enclosure wall.

During the Fourth Anglo Dutch War (1780-1784) the Estates General of the Netherlands decided to send a navy squadron under command of captain J.P. van Braam to the East Indies. The warships arrived in Batavia in March 1784. The war between the two countries was already over, but the navy arrived just in time to relieve Malacca, which was besieged by the Bunginese. The ships left to the Lingga-Riau archipelago where the Buginese forts were attacked and destroyed. The Sultan of Lingga-Riau signed a treaty, which gave the Dutch permission to build a fort on Bintang island. In 1795 the Dutch left the island under threat of an English invasion and left the fort to the Sultan. On November 1818 a Dutch navy squadron under command of rear admiral C.J. Wolterbeek arrived before Riau. The sultan signed a treaty with the Dutch , which included the rebuilding of the demolished fort. After various problems, the fort was only completed in 1824. Fort Kroonpins (Crown Prince), which had an irregular shape, was surrounded by a moat. The house of the commanding officer and the hospital stood outside the walls. The remains that can still be seen today are those of the 19th century fortification.

The founding of Beverwijck in 1652 did not take away the need to provide for fortifications to protect colonists living north of the new village. Most, if not all, of those living there were tenants or employees of the patroonship of Rensselaerswijck. As relations between the court of Rensselaerswijck and the court of Fort Orange and Beverwijck were strained, intervention by higher authority was required. In May 1653, director general and council reiterated their previous order to construct a blockhouse.According to Jan Baptist van Rensselaer, this was “a redoubt on the Fifth Kill for the protection of the grist mill.” It is unknown whether the planned fortification was carried out as planned.

The Forte dos Reis Magos or Fortaleza dos Reis Magos (Fortress of Three Wise Men), is a fortress located in the city of Natal in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte. The fortress was founded on the south side of the bar of the Potengi River after the Portuguese conquest of the region. It received its name based on the date of commencement of its construction, 6 January 1598, at Epiphany in the Catholic calendar. - In 1633 the WIC in Brazil decided to undertake an expedition to conquer the Fortress of Reis Magos. The expedition sailed on 5 December 1633 from Recife and consisted of 800 men commanded by Delegated Director Van Ceulen, Lieutenant Colonel Bylsma, Political Councillor Carpentier and Admiral Lichthart. The fleet landed part of the force at Punto Negro and these troops marched to the castle which they reached at nightfall. The next day they started making approaches and after landing some pieces of artillery, started to shoot at the castle with mortars from batteries they constructed in the dunes. These siege works constitute a multiple object. - After several days of bombardment the garrison of 80 Portuguese surrendered and 9 bronze and 22 iron pieces were found in the castle. Major Garstman was left with 150 men to occupy the castle which was baptized Casteel Ceulen and on 20 December the fleet returned to Recife where it arrived on 27 December.

In late 1643, in reaction to the outbreak of hostilities between colonists and Native Americans in the Lower Hudson Valley, Kiliaen van Rensselaer, patroon of Rensselaerswijck, decided to establish a fortified place to which his colonists could retreat in time of need. For this purpose he selected Beeren Island (now called Barren Island, although no longer an island, south of Coeymans, on the Hannacrois Creek), renaming it Rensselaersstein (fig. 13). Beeren Island constituted the southern border of the patroonship and, with the recent opening of the fur trade to private traders in mind, Van Rensselaer also conferred upon the island the staple right of Rensselaerswijck, thus forcing private ships to break bulk there for inspection and the payment of tolls. In this way, Van Rensselaer asserted the rights of his patroonship, but it was likely to put him on a collision course with both the West India Company and private traders. At the same time, Van Rensselaer appointed Nicolaes Coorn to be commander (wachtmeester) of Rensselaersstein. \t \t Coorn sailed from Amsterdam in September 1643 on the Wapen van Rensselaerswijck, which also carried a large amount of ammunition and equipment for the planned fortification, including two iron three-pounders, one cannon of 1310 pound, gun carriages, carriage wheels, tackle blocks, forty cannon balls of five and six pounds, cartridge paper, cylindrical brushes, cartridge sticks, a large ammunition chest, two hundred pounds of lead and shot, three hundred pounds of powder, eighteen muskets, five firelocks, two pistols, eighteen spears, sixteen broadswords, six entrenching tools, and twelve shovels and spades, for a grand total of ƒ 1904:18:8. When the Wapen van Rensselaerswijck arrived in New Amsterdam in March 1644, its military cargo did not go unnoticed. New Netherland fiscaal Cornelis van der Hoykens, tasked with defending the Company's rights, quickly got wind of Van Rensselaer's plans “to erect a fortress” on Beeren Island. In the opinion of Van der Hoykens, Beeren Island was outside of the limits of the patroonship and he considered Van Rensselaer's attempt to erect a fortress there (which could command the river and thus shut off the West India Company's Fort Orange) an attack on the prerogatives of the Company. The fiscaal's official protest was met with a counter-protest by Coorn, who warned Van der Hoykens not “to frustrate the intended design” on Beeren Island. Both men thus having duly defended the rights of their respective masters, Coorn was allowed to ship all his equipment and personnel upriver. \t     Although no information is available as to what the fortification may have looked like, there is no doubt that Coorn established himself on Beeren Island. A few months later, private trader Govert Loockermans sailed down the Hudson from Fort Orange in the yacht Goede Hoope. When the yacht passed Beeren Island, Nicolaes Coorn called out to Loockermans, ordering him to strike his flag. When asked for whom, Coorn replied: “For the stapleright of Rensselaerswijck.” Loockermans was not impressed: “I strike for no man except the Prince of Orange and the lords that I serve.” Coorn thereupon fired a canon, with the shot going through the mainsail and damaging some of the rigging. Loockermans cried out: “Fire, you dogs; may the Devil take you!” The second shot missed completely. The third shot hit the Prince's flag, about a foot above the head of Loockermans who held the flag in his hand. The Goede Hoope sailed on without firing back only for the crew to make depositions in New Amsterdam later, so that Coorn could be sued for damages. \t\t\t    Later references to Rensselaersstein indicate that the West India Company directors in Amsterdam took a dim view of what they regarded as the illegal usurpations of Rensselaerswijck. The fortification is described as “a certain house named Rensselaersstein,” which may suggest it was built as a blockhouse. An inventory dated 1652 of the papers and goods of the patroon's house in Rensselaerswijck lists “a few stones retrieved from Rensselaersstein,” which suggest that the fortification at Beeren Island was abandoned and dismantled, probably when Nicolaes Coorn succeeded Adriaen van der Donck as schout of Rensselaerswijck and moved north to the main part of the patroonship in 1646.

In May 1615 a small VOC-fleet under command of Adriaan van der Dussen and Pieter van den Broecke visited the island of Ay. The island, a source of nutmeg, was occupied without losses. A few days later, however, the local population decided to resist the invaders and the VOC had to withdraw from the island, having incurred heavy losses. In April 1616 Van der Dussen returned and the island was occupied again. The population had to submit themselves to the VOC. Those who refused were forced from their stronghold in the north onto a high cliff where many jumped to their death in the sea below. On the ruins of the local fort the VOC would construct a new fortification : Revengie (revenge), a pentagonal fort with five corner bastions. Though the Heren XVII protested the construction of yet another fort in the Moluccas, the Council of the Indies calmly ignored this protest and the fort was completed. In 1683 the fort was heavily damaged by an earthquake, but restored. In the eighteenth century, the fort was used as a prison for high company officials and other prisoners of high rank. It was again restored in 1753 and would remain in use until the end of the eighteenth century. A notable feature of the fort are many rain-water cisterns built in the curtain wall and underneath the terreplein. The fort had a good supply of fresh water due to the sophisticated filtration and catchment system.

The earthwork Rijswijk (I), which was designed by surveyor Johannes Listingh, consisted of a rectangular stone redoubt within an earthen rampart and a moat. The fort lay about three kilometres south of the city of Batavia between the rice fields on the East side of Kali Krokot. It owed the name Rijswijk to the rice fields. The earthwork controlled the access along the kali Krokot and the connection between the Molenvliet and the Krokot. In 1668 a new fort was built about 500 metres further east, at the connection of the Molenvliet on the Nieuwe Vaart to Noordwijk, as a replacement of the existing fort, which was likewise called Rijswijk (II) . The old fort was abandoned in 1697 and demolished in 1720. There are no visible remains of the fort today.

The fort replaced the existing post Rijswijk I at the Kali Krokot. During the Chinese uprising in 1740 the soldiers demolished Rijswijk and escaped to Batavia. - In 1741 Governor-General Adriaen Valckenier (1737-1741) gave order to occupy and rebuild the post it was rebuilt as a square stones redoubt with eight cannons to the road along the west side of the Molenvliet. From there it was possible to fire at the roads along the Molenvliet and Nieuwe Vaart. About 1770 fort Rijswijk was extended with a walled area with two half bastions, a guard house, a residence for the post guard, two wooden barracks and an drilling area. - Governor General Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811) demolished the fort to make space for the construction of camp Weltevreden, which in turn was demolished in the second half of the 20th century.

After the peace of 1660, a house (huys aent strandt) was constructed on the Rondout Creek, near the place where ships coming in from the Hudson River found a suitable anchorage. The construction was presumably located at about a distance of four kilometres (“a march of one hour and half” ) from the village, on the north bank of the Creek, in the area where streets called Dock Street, Rondout Landing, and East Strand Street indicate the maritime background. It is possible, although more research is required, that the 'house' (later on usually called the redoubt (reduyt)) was connected to Wiltwijck by what now is called Foxhall Avenue, which shows up on early maps. - In the wake of the Indian attack of June 1663, the redoubt played an important role as a communication hub. Although only a few soldiers manned the redoubt, the Esopus Indians did not attack it. The day after the Indian assault, a group of ten horsemen galloped from the village to the redoubt, carrying a letter calling for help, which was immediately sent on to New Amsterdam with a yacht. During the war against the Esopus Indians in the following months, the redoubt continued to be manned by a small garrison and served as a conduit for communication and transport of goods between Wiltwijck and the Hudson River, both for colonists and Indians from neighbouring groups, such as the Wappingers.

In addition to the VOC posts on Ambon's north coast, on the west coast a trade post was established to safeguard the spice monopoly at the village of Larike. The post was established on the left bank of a river mouth. In 1625 palisade walls where built to protect the wooden houses of the trade post against attacks from the people of Ternate. Two round, earth-filled towers were built on two of the opposite corners of the squire palisade structure and a sergeant with seventeen soldiers and four artillery pieces were stationed here to defend it. In 1633 governor Aert Gijsels started the construction of a more solid stone blockhouse, which was completed in 1634. This was just in time, because tensions were growing between the VOC and the people of Hitu about the spice monopoly. This eventually led to a revolt. Larike remained loyal to the VOC and was unsuccessfully attacked several times between 1635 and 1639. During a raid in august 1641 the village was burned, only the blockhouse which formed the home of the head merchant was not occupied and survived. Initially the structure had simply been known as fort Larike, only in 1656 it was renamed “Rotterdam” by governor De Vlaming van Oudshoorn. The post remained in use by the Dutch until 1873, although it was occupied by the British between 1776 and 1817. Today only parts of the walls still stand. These remains have now become integrated into houses of local people.

The fort of Ujung Pandang was originally constructed in the mid-1630s as part of a great fortification programme by the rulers of the dual kingdom of Gowa-Talloq, of which Makassar was the main harbour and trade entrepôt. Faced with an increasing threat from the Dutch East India Company (VOC), which was at war with Makassar and regularly blockaded the harbour from 1634 until 1637, it reinforced its existenting fortifications (e.g. Somba Opu, the palace complex of the sultan of Gowa) and built several new ones, Ujung Pandang being one of them. Ujung Pandang was ceded to the VOC in 1667 as part of the provisions of the Bungaya Treaty, which sultan Hasanuddin of Gowa was forced to sign after his defeat in the Makassar War at the hands of the combined forces of the VOC and its local allies under the leadership of the Buginese nobleman Arung Palakka. The fort was renamed Fort Rotterdam, after the birth town of the VOC commander Cornelis Jansz. Speelman. It subsequently became the VOC headquarters when the Makassar War flared up again (Gowa was once again defeated in 1669), and in the course of the 1670s, was rebuilt in a European fashion with 5 bastions, giving it the characteristic 'tortoise' shape that it has to this day. In 1679, a ravelin was added. A protestant church, residences for VOC officials, barracks, weapon storehouses and other buildings were erected within the fort. From the 1970s onwards, the fort was extensively restored. Today, it is a cultural attraction and public space, and houses Museum La Galigo, and the South Sulawesi Province Museum.

In 1605 the Dutch under command of Cornelis Sebastiaansz and their Ternatan allies occupied the fort. - It is unknown how many years the Dutch occupied the fort and when the Spanish seized Rum. - In November 1618 the Sultan of Tidore send a letter to the Spanish governor of Ternate Lucas Vergara Gabiria and asked him to build a fort in Rum to neutralize the Dutch fort Mareku. - The new fort should prevent the Dutch from collecting the cloves that were produced in abundance along the slopes of the island. Fort Rum, which was a terraced structure, was built leaning on a coral wall which made its building process quite difficult, particularly as building materials needed to be transported up the hill. The Dutch attempted an attack against the fort under construction, but did not have any results because the location of the Spanish fort dominated the area. - In 1627 the fort on the hill, which was called Rum, was a square stronghold and equipped with 4 pieces of artillery. On the beach was a half-moon (De Platte Form) with five canons to secure the roadsteads. The location was excellent, because it covered the passage between Tidore and Melayu (fort Orange) on Ternate so that no enemy ship could pass them unnoticed.- In 1663 the Spanish left their forts in the North Moluccas. The Dutch occupied fort Rum but in 1664 the VOC gave the fort to Sultan Saifoeddin who used it as barracks for his Dutch bodyguard. - In the 1930s the fort was still in good condition. In the beginning of this century the main part of the fort was demolished by the construction of the coastal road. Only a small part of the round structure at the edge of the hill next to the sea still exists. Near the fort is a monument to remember the arrival of the Portuguese on Tidore.

The Dutch, who had been expelled from Ceará by the uprising of the indigenous population in 1644, received signals from this same population that their return would not be unwelcome. The situation had changed considerably in the meanwhile, as the uprising of the Portuguese 'moradores' in 1645 had reduced Dutch rule to the beleaguered city of Recife, Itamaracá, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. The WIC was desperate to realise returns from its Brazilian holdings, now that most of the sugar producing areas had been lost to the Portuguese. The prospect of exploiting silver mines in Ceará seemed an interesting suggestion. Gisbert de With, a member of the Dutch political elite in Recife, was approached to head an expedition to Ceará, but he declined after the disastrous Dutch defeat in the second battle at Guararapes in 1649. The post was then offered to Mathias Beck, a member of the Dutch business community in Recife, who accepted (Hulsman 2005a: 42). - Beck left Recife in March 1649 and the expedition reached Mucuripe Bay on April 3rd.. They chose a location on the left bank of the Pajeú River to erect a new fortification, which they baptized Fort Schoonenborch in honour of the political councillor Wouter Schoonenborch, president of the WIC government in Recife at that time. They cleared the terrain and took part of their building materials from the ruins of Fort Sebastião. The fort was designed by the English architect Richard Carr. The fort was probably gradually enlarged in the period 1649-1653 (Werneck 2006; Krommen 2001). The garrison of the fort consisted of 108 people in February 1653 (1.01.02_5764) - The rendition of Dutch Brazil in January 1654 angered the Amerindian allies of the Dutch to the point that they beleaguered Fort Schoonenborch. The Dutch were saved by the Portuguese. On May 20, 1654 a ship arrived carrying Portuguese troops and the Dutch handed over the fort. A Portuguese ship carrying the Dutch left on June 1, 1654 and brought them to the island of Barbados. Capitão-mor Álvaro de Azevedo Barreto took command of the fort which was baptized Forte de Nossa Senhora da Assunção (NL-HaNA_1.05.01.01_67_96). The artillery rendered to the Portuguese is shown in table 1 below.

In 1695, the High Government decided to build a pentagonal brick fort at Kali Semarang north of the Chinese and Javanese settlement. After the work was finished in 1708 the fort got a garrison of 130 man. The bastions were called Zeeland, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Raamsdonk en Bunschoten. - After the construction of the fort the headquarters of the VOC settlements on the north coast moved from Jepara to Semarang, which had a good connection with the court of Mataram in Kartasoera. - During the Chinese Mataram uprising (1740-1743) the forts of the VOC at Kartasoera, Rembang and Demak were captured. The rebels attacked Semarang, which was undefended except for the fort. In a hurry earthen embankments and trenches were made as a line of defense. Against all expectations the defenders held out against a greater number of Chinese and Javanese attackers. After five months the siege was lifted by reinforcement arriving by ship from Batavia and Makassar. It proofed to be a turning point in the war. In November 1743 susuhunan Pakoebewono II signed a peace treaty in which he had to cede the north coast of Java to the Company. - The siege was the reason for the construction of a circumvallation wall around the city. The existing fort was demolished in 1746 with the exception of two bastions which became a part of the new brick wall. Semarang had a city plan of 600 x 400 meter with a bulge in the northwest corner, on the site of the demolished fort. The Chinese settlement, which was demolished to get a free field of fire, was rebuilt on the west bank of Kali Semarang. - After 1785 plans were developed to defend Semarang against an invasion of a European enemy. Surveyor Carl Friederich Reimer made designs of a modern circumvallation with a citadel and coastal batteries, but these were never built. - In 1824 the 18th century fortifications of Semarang were demolished and the moat filled. - Today there are no visible remains left of the fortifications of the VOC. Between 2000 and 2010 archaeologist excavated parts of the city wall and the fort.

Ceará was not settled by the Portuguese during the 16th century. In the 17th century Portugal wanted to form a military base in Ceará to support the Portuguese operations in the war against the French who were active on the coast after being expelled from Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. The earliest Portuguese settlement was established near the mouth of the Ceará River in 1603 by Pero Coelho de Sousa. He established the fort of São Tiago, but one year later he abandoned Ceará because of a period of drought. - The French continued operating from Maranhão and Ibiapaba, where they had established a base in 1590. In 1612 the Portuguese Martim Soares Moreno constructed the fortress of São Sebastião on the same site as São Tiago as part of the campaign to expel the French from Maranhão. The fort was located on the right bank of the estuary of the Ceará River. - The Portuguese fort continued till 1637 when the Dutch, having established themselves in Rio Grande do Norte, sent a force to Ceará. The Dutch received help from local indigenous chiefs like Algodão, who sent 200 warriors, and they conquered the small fortress without any problem, capturing three guns. (Barlaeus 1923: 81-82). - The fort was garrisoned with some 40 men under the command of Lieutenant Van der Ham. (Barlaeus 1923: 82-84). Van der Ham was replaced by Gedion Morris in 1641. Morris participated in the attack on São Luis de Maranhão in December 1641, together with an indigenous force from Ceará. He returned in 1644 to Ceará and was killed by the Amerindians who had risen against the Dutch rule. The Dutch garrison of São Sebastião was probably overrun and there are no reports of any survivors (Barretto 2010: 50-52; Hulsman 2008: 4-6).

The sultan of Ternate had a pleasure ground in Sidangoli, where he went deer hunting. The village lay in an area where the Dutch East India Company regularly organized hongi expeditions to destroy clove trees outside the areas under their control. - The fort is square with a half bastion in the southeast corner. It is unknown when and by whom it was built. It occurs on a map of the island of Ternate, Ternate Islands ', Batahina, Maquian and Batchian Tidor, Halmaheira '' by Isaac de Graaff, made between 1680-1683. The locals called the fort Kota Intan (Diamond City). The VOC had a shipyard for the construction of small vessels in Sidangoli. - In 1797 Prince Nuku of Tidore captured Ternate with English support. His supporters laid siege to fort Sidangoli in 1801 but were driven out by the 70 soldiers. Afterwards the garrison left the redoubt. In 1865 there was a small garrison in fort Sidangoli. In 2007 parts of the wall of the fort were still standing.

In 1679 the VOC bought the estate for the leprosy.. The building became at a tavern, which was leased together with the oyster bank before the coast. A visit to the tavern was a popular day trip of the people of Batavia. The profit from Slingerland was used to finance the leprosy on the island of Purmerend (today Pulau Bidadari). - In the 18th century an earthen coastal battery was built on the peninsula behind the tavern. In 1765 Johannes Rach, himself a major of the artillery, drew the gunnery practice at Slingerland. In 1788 Carl Friederich Reimer made a map of the defences of Batavia, which shows the mouth of Antjol river was protected by two batteries: Slingerland on the right bank and the battery Zeelucht on the left bank. Battery Slingelandt is no longer visible on the map of Pieter Tency (1797). Today the site of battery Slingerlandt is a part of the recreation area Ancol. There are no visible remains left.

Fort Sommelsdijk was the second most important fortification in the colony of Surinam from the late 17th century until the construction of fort Nieuw Amsterdam in the mid-18th century. The decision to construct Sommelsdijk, a large earthen fortification with five bastions was taken in May 1684, in order to cover the plantation areas on the Upper Commewijne and the Cottica where many planters from the Suriname River had settled because of the Indian War (1678-1686). Actual work, to a design by Robert Paen, at that time an army captain leading a company in the Suriname garrison, only commenced two years later and was finished in 1688. That year the fort was also officially named Sommelsdijck, after Cornelis van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck, the man on whose initiative it was built and first Governor for the Society of Surinam; before that it had been referred to as Fort Commewijne or Fort Cottica. In 1748 Sommelsdijck was abandoned as a first line of defence fortification, even though a small infantry detachment continued to be stationed there.

For many years Banten (Bantam) was Batavia's greatest competitor. It was an important harbour town where European and Asian merchants bought pepper. The VOC tried to outplay its competitors through blockades. In 1682, the Dutch had a unique opportunity to outplay Banten. The ruling Sultan, Abdul Kahar Abun Nazar, also known as Sultan Hadji, requested their assistance in the fight against his father and rival Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa. The VOC dispatched soldiers and the civil war took a decisive development, favouring Sultan Hadji. The assistance came at a price. On April 17, 1684, the sultan signed a treaty which accorded the VOC the sole right to trade in the kingdom of Banten. To ensure that the treaty was adhered to, a fort was built opposite the city. The rudimentary elements were already there; in 1682 a group of sailors under the command of Rombout van Hoogstraten occupied a bastion in the sea wall of Banten and called it Fort “Speelwijk”, after the Governor General Cornelis Jansz Speelman (1681-1684). Surveyor Ewout Verhagen incorporated the existing structures into his design of the new fort: Speelwijk became the north bastion and the Banten sea wall served as the connection with the new northeast bastion Zeewijk. The southwest bastion was given the name Rivierpunt. On the fourth corner was a half bastion named Rottenest (later Nieuwpunt). From this bastion was it possible to fire at the Sultan's palace Diamant. On three sides of the fort was a moat, while on the south side a small piece of land separated it from Banten River. The construction began in 1685 with the erection of a wooden palisade. The land was piled up and temporary bamboo buildings erected, which were replaced by stone ones after the construction of the stone wall. Within the fort there were watch-posts, storages, barracks, workshops, commander's dwelling and a church. There were three entrance gates: The Land gate at the riverside, the Water gate and the small commander's gate in the sea wall. Fort Speelwijk was completed in 1686. The armament comprised 48 cannons. In the 18th century, some improvements were made, such as the construction of ammunition cellars and improvement of the hospital and barracks. Because the fort was located on the coast and potable water was in short supply, the soldiers suffered from tropical diseases. Governor General Herman Daendels (1808-1811) planned to demolish the fort. His plans were overtaken by the clash that erupted between him and the sultan which resulted in Banten being directly subjugated under Dutch authority in 1810. The fort had lost its purpose, was abandoned and fell into decay. In 1911, Governor General Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg (1909-1916) visited Banten. He ordered the remains of the fort and the European cemetery to be cleaned up and maintained. As a result, Fort Speelwijk became the first protected monument or cultural heritage property in the Netherland East Indies. It was the first step to the “Monumenten Ordonnantie” (monument law) of 1931.Today Fort Speelwijk, which is well maintained, serves as a tourist attraction.

The first kraton or royal palace of the sultanate Banten (Bantam) was constructed during the reign of Sultan Maulana Hasanuddin (1552-1570) He gave it the name Surosowan at the advice of his father, Sunan Gunung Jati. It was also called “Gedong Kedaton Pakuwuan”. The encircling wall which was made of bricks and coral stones, was built by his successor Sultan Maulana Yusuf (1570-1580). During his reign Banten became a big city and also an international trade center, replacing Malacca which in 1511 had fallen into Portuguese hands in the beginning of the 16th century. Merchants from many countries in Asia and Europe who refused to trade with the Portuguese preferred to sail to Banten. Following the great fires in 1605 and 1607, the royal palace was completely rebuilt on the same location. Surosowan was encircled by 2-meter high and 5-meter thick brick walls. The area inside the walls measured 300 x 100 meters with a total area of around 3 hectares. Initially, the walls were only to prevent commoners from seeing the palace inhabitants, and not as a protection against attacks. During the reign of Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa (1651–1672) a war broke out with his son Abdul Kahar Abun Nazar, also known as Sultan Sultan Hadji (1671-1690). Hadji fortified the royal palace. He was besieged but was released upon the arrival of Dutch soldiers. The support of the VOC during the civil war eventually led to Banten becoming subordinated to Batavia. The Dutch built Fort Speelwijk to control their influence on the sultan in his palace After the civil war, damages to the royal palace were repaired. The Dutch stone-mason Hendrik Lucasz Cardeel, who took the name of Pangeran Wira Goena after converting to Islam, built in a rectangular new wall in 1680-1681 with bastions at the four corners, ravelins and a gate on the north side. It was made of bricks and coral stones The Dutch renamed the fortified royal palace Fort Diamant (Kota Intan). In the 18th century, the buildings inside the palace were expanded several times. In 1701, Sultan Zainul Abidin installed water pipes between the pools of his country house at Tasik Ardi and the palace. Governor General Daendels (1808-1811) planned to establish a marine port at Meeuwenbaai (Teluk Peucang). He ordered the Sultan to provide laborers for the groundwork. The location was extremely unhealthy, killing a great number of workers and causing many others to run away. Daendels saw this as opposition of the sultan and the royal administrator. During the negotiations the emissaries and their escorts were murdered. With 1,000 men, Daendels immediately stormed Fort Diamant which was defended by 3,000 men. The Sultan was taken prisoner and the royal administrator executed Banten was declared a Dutch territory. Fort Diamant must be demolished, but that didn't happen before 1832 because the people refused to demolish the symbol of their rulers. In 1893, the curator of the ethnographic collection at the Batavia Museum, Serrurier, obtained a map depicting the remnants of the city. Between 1915 and 1930, the Oudheidkundige Dienst (Archaeological Office) restored the ruins. The Indonesian government continued the restoration work and research activities. In the 1970s and 1980 archaeological excavations were conducted. The Banten museum was opened in 1985.

In 1631 thirty-two colonists settled on what is now Lewes Creek near Cape Henlopen with the intention to engage in whaling and cultivating tobacco. Within a year, Native Americans attacked the fledgling patroonship, killing all colonists. David Pietersz de Vries, whose few lines are the main source, refers to a small fort (fortjen) and a house (Huys), “encircled with a palisade instead of a parapet.” \tThe location of this fort is supposed to be on Pilottown Road, near the twentieth-century De Vries monument. Yet the first archaeological search in 1952 initially failed to provide a positive identification. A ca. 1630 map (fig. 8) suggests that a square-shaped palisade with two points surrounded the house. Even though the fort is drawn out of scale and the map should not be interpreted as an accurate representation, it still provided important guidance to the further explorations, as archaeologists searched for the bastion closest to the Lewes Creek, called “Bloemmaerts Kil” on the map. In the following years, over two hundred separate postholes and molds were uncovered. While some of these may have resulted from the construction of the 1630s palisade, others are evidence of the posts of a much later farmer's fence. Several fragments of glazed redware, white earthenware, and glass, as well as pieces of glass bottles were found, but these all date back to the eighteenth century. The only artifacts possibly indicative of the early Dutch settlement found in 1954 were yellow Dutch bricks, presumably used in building the house inside the stockade. Further research in 1964 discovered what Chesleigh A. Bonine considered the remains of the south point of the palisade. According to him, the traces of charcoal found in the subsoil along the postmold lines correspond with De Vries's statement that the palisade was “mostly burned” during the attack. While Bonine has little doubt about the exact location of the Swanendael settlement, the archaeological findings of the 1950s and 1960s are nowadays considered inconclusive, casting doubt on the location as well. It seems likely that what Bonine and others excavated were the remains of a battery shown on a 1773 map. \tIn some of the secondary literature, the fort at Swanendael is called “Fort Oplandt.” This is based on a nineteenth-century misreading of a phrase in the account of De Vries about the massacre of 1631, which killed “two and thirty men, who were outside the fort on the land to do their work.” The location Uppland or Oplant mentioned several times in later Dutch records is located much higher on the Delaware River, just west of Tinicum Island.

In the 17th century Tanbanio or Tabenjouw was a small village at the river Tanbanio at the south coast of Kalimantan. It was a strategic area with high economic potentials because of the pepper, fisheries, and the gold mines in Palaihari area, southeast of the fort. On July 6, 1779 the VOC signed a contract with the Sultan of Banjarmasin about the trade monopoly. Article 7 regulated the construction of a fort at Tabanio. The fort was an irregular quadrangle. In 1791 engineer J.C. Reimer designed a big fort on the same location. It is uncertain when the fort was build, but there are 19th century pictures the fort. Governor General Hendrik Willem Daendels (1808-1811) ordered the abandonment of the loss-making trading post on Kalimantan, including Tabanio. In 1816 the British refused to return the Dutch possessions, but both governments signed an agreement. In 1826 Sultan Adam of the Bandjarmasin realm made an agreement with the Dutch East India government in which he parted with the sparsely populates area around Tabanio (Tanahlaut). The fort was used by the civil government. In 1854 the government moved from Tabanio to Palaihari and the fort was abandoned. This part of Kalimantan became more and more important because of the coalmines which produced fuel for the growing number of steamships. In May 1859 a revolt against the Dutch broke out, which was afterwards called the Banjermasin war (1859-1863). A group of rebels under Idris occupied the fort in Tabanio and murdered the post holder. Idris got the title of kiay demang Lehman, raised many supporters and became one of the most important leaders of the revolt against the Dutch. The Dutch retook the fort in August 1859. Fifty foot soldiers and two cannon were stationed in the fort. Tabanio became the basecamp for the pacification of the area. Fort Tabanio, which was listed as a fort of the 4the class (against a native enemy), was removed from the list of defense works of the Dutch East Indies. Today only the only remaining part of the fort is the moat. Archaeological excavations have revealed remains of the buildings.

On 8 October 1608 a small fleet under command of Vice Admiral Simon Jansz Hoen left Makian and sailed to Ternate. The Dutch landed at Takome and started with the construction of a fort on the ruins of an older, probably Portuguese, fort on a 20 meter high Hill. On 16 October, the defenders managed to defeat an attack of 80 Spaniards and 300 to 400 mardijkers. The new fort, named Willemstad , had five bastions. It had a garrison of 100 men under the command of a captain and a lieutenant. The local people, who had fled because of the war, returned to Takome. The town was according to contemporary sources “a beautiful place with neat streets”. It was surrounded by a stone wall with a bastion on the landward side. There were about 1000 people there. Takome was an important place as collecting point of cloves. With the decline of the harvest of cloves the importance of the place also declined. In 1633 there were only 18 soldiers left in the fort. Johan Ottens (Governor of the Moluccas, 1633-1635) proposed to further reduce the number of soldiers. In 1651 the last soldiers were withdrawn on orders of Governor Caspar van Boogaarde (1633-1635). The fort fell into disrepair. In 1690 an official order was given to demolish fort Willemstad. The survey of the site by PDA in 2007 discovered some overgrown ruins.

During the war with Bantam in 1684 the VOC built an army camp in Babakan near Tangerang. After the war an earthen fort with a palisade and tower was built near the bridge over the river in Tangerang. Around 1708 the wooden fort was replaced by a stone fort which had an unusual shape: a square with two normal bastions at the land side and two half bastions with a half circular extension opposite the river. The canons didn't stand on the wall but behind round embrasures in the wall. Inside the fort were the houses of the officer in charge and the assistant pastor (<ziekentrooster>), guardhouse, powderhouse and munition store. In 1779 there was a garrison of 38 men under command of an officer. - Around 1800 the construction of a new fort started, but in 1808 governor-general Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811) stopped the work to cut back on spending. In the 19th century the old fort no longer had a military purpose and the buildings were used as a prison. Today the shopping mall Plaza Tangerang stands on the site of the fort near the bridge over the river Cisadane. The only reminder of the fort is the name of the street: Jalan Bentang Raya (Great Fort Street).

In 1756 the sultan of Banjarmasin asked the support of the VOC against the Bugis. In the treaty between Sultan Banjermassin and Johan Andreas Paravinci of October 1756, the VOC got permission to build a stone fort to protect her own and the sultans interest: Fort Tatas. Fort Tatas was a polygonal structure with a palisade. There were 3 bastions facing the river and 2 bastions facing the landside. The sultan of Banjarmasi informally ceded sovereignty to the Dutch in 1786–1787, though he retained the throne. In April 1876 it was decided to build a new fort of the fourth class (against a native enemy) on the site of the old VOC fort. In 1901 Governor General Willem Rooseboom (1899-1904) removed Tatas from the list of permanent forts in the Dutch East Indies. In 1981 the Sabilala Muhtadin Great Mosque was built on the site of the fort. The moat is the only still existing part of the second fort.

In the eighteenth century the Company settlement of Tegal, some eighty kilometers east of Cirebon, was important for its rice deliveries to Batavia from the hinterland, which until 1743 was still Mataram territory. In 1708 the existing pagger (wooden fort) was replaced by a stone fort with two diagonal bastions, which was rebuilt in 1754. It was extended around 1780 when four bastions were added. Between 1853 and 1863 the fort was listed as a fort of the fourth category (against a native enemy). When it was removed from the list of forts in 1863, there was a garrison of 50 soldiers and one officer. A part of the complex was already used as a prison. The fort was transferred to the civil government and is still used as a prison. The two bastions at the north side have been replaced by watch towers. The gate has been replaced by a modern office building.

In 1772 the Hindu realm Blambangan in the extreme easterly point of Java came under the rule of the VOC. Initially Ulumpangan became the chief settlement of the company, but in 1790 the company moved her headquarter to Banjuwangi on the Bali Straits. Here a military post was built near the mouth of the river. Another important building in the city was the Bandit's place for people because Banjuwangi was a penal colony. In 1801, Captain J. Schmaltz of the Engineer Corps designed a large fort to replace the small blockhouse, but is was never built. In 1811 Banjoewangi became the terminus of the Great Post Road of governor general Daendels. The Blockhouse Utrecht was reinforced. During the British period (1811-1816) it was a small fort with 150 soldiers. An attack of pirates was repulsed. After the return of the Dutch in 1816 they laid a garrison in the fort. In the 1840s, the inside of the fort included one house for the officers, one barrack for European and one for native soldiers, two warehouses, one powder-house, a guardhouse and a military prison. There was a garrison of 1 First lieutenant, a Second lieutenant, 44 native infantry, six European and 14 native artillery soldiers. In the barracks also lived 31 women and 21 children. The fort had nine cannon: three twelve pounders and six six-pounders. Shortly afterwards the fort became a prison and a school. The gate of fort Utrecht was dismantled between 1927 and 1929. The other buildings have also largely been demolished. The only remains of the ruins are walls, which are now part of houses of the local people.

The redoubt Utrecht, built on a high sand dune to the south of Fort Zeelandia, was a supporting fortification meant to prevent the dune from being taken in case of a siege, as the dune might be used to fire into the fort. During the siege of fort Zeelandia by the Chinese warlord Koxinga in 1661-1662 there was fierce fighting for the redoubt, and it was finally taken on the night of the 25th of January 1625. This left the besieged in Fort Zeelandia in a hopeless position, and negotiations for the surrender of the fort commenced two days later.

In 1746 Susuhunan Pakubuwono II (ruling 1726-1749) moved from Kartasura to his new royal palace in Surakarta. Governor General Baron von Imhoff (in office 1743-1750) was eager to build a small fort, which was named Grootmoedigheid (Generosity) opposite of the kraton. The plans for a more permanent fort may well have been made not long after the Giyanti Treaty was signed in 1755. In 1775 it was reported that the outer part of the fort in Surakarta had been completed and cannons were even provided by susuhunan Pakubuwono III (ruling 1749-1788). The VOC fort in Surakarta was finally declared complete in 1779 and could be utilized in 1780. This fort was named Vastenburg (steadfast, durable). It is square with four bastions and a moat. Following the reorganization of the Dutch-Indies Army after the Diponegoro War (1825-1830) Fort Vastenburg was improved in 1832—the year “1832” can be seen near the north entrance door. In 1987 the army left the fort and moved to another location. The new owner, a real estate developer, wanted to build a hotel on the site. Between 1987 and 2007 the buildings in side the fort were demolished, but the wall and gates were still undamaged. The work stopped after protestst from the local population. The future of fort Vastenburg is still uncertain.

In 1623 it the people of Ternate first built a small fort on Sanana Island in the Sula archipelago, which stood under Ternate's political control. In documents dating from around 1688 and later also in the work of François Valentyn, the fort is referred to as 'vesting 't Claverblad', (the name meaning cloverleaf). In 1689 the fort was such a bad condition that it was proposed to rebuild it or even relocate it from Ipa village to Satamata. Finally in 1736 during the rule of Sultan Amir Iskandar Zulkarnain Saifuddin, the new fort was rebuilt and renamed Fort De Verwachting. This was done under the supervision of VOC officer Victor Moll, who used the services of Ternate people. Their craftsmanship can still be seen in the Ternate ornaments on the walls of the fort. The inscriptions on the gate and walls are in the Malay language. In VOC documents dating from the end of the 18th century the fort is also referred to as Fort Alting, named after Governor –General Willem Arnold Alting (1780-1797), but has been best known as Fort De Verwachting (the expectation). In 1890 the fort is described as in bad state of repair. At that time it was the dwelling place of the Salahakan, the representative of the Sultan of Ternate. In the decades that followed the fort must have been repaired, because after a visit in1921 Dutch historian Victor van de Wall describes the fort as being in a good condition. At that time several cannons were again placed on the walls, the white washed buildings inside the fort were in use and VOC period graves just outside the walls were kept. Today the buildings inside the fort have been cleared and a playground has been built here. The 4 meter high ramparts with an arched gate and two bastions with spy towers are still intact, and some cannons can still be found scattered around the location.

Long before the Dutch arrived, the Portuguese settled on Ambon. The first Portuguese stronghold on the bay of Ambon was built in 1576. Around 1580 this structure was replaced by a better fort with four bastions, closer to the shore. It was named Forte de Nossa Senhora da Anunciada in Portuguese and was locally known as Kota Laha. On February 23 1605 the Portuguese surrendered this fort to VOC Admiral Steven van der Hagen without a shot being fired. In gratitude for what seemed to have been a god-given victory, the fort was renamed Victoria by the Dutch. It became the seat of the first Dutch territory in the Indies, the Government of Amboina. The first to hold the position of governor was Frederik de Houtman (1605-1611). For the years that followed the fort served as the general administrative center for the VOC in Asia, before it was shifted first to Fort Oranje in Ternate and later to Batavia. Fort Victoria was rebuild and strengthened multiple times. As described in 1627, initially the fort had two gates and four bastions, with the bastions facing the landside being bigger and higher. A one and a half meter deep moat filled with water surrounded the structure. Within the walls there were spaces to store trade goods and weapons and accommodations for people in service of the VOC. Earthquakes that took place in 1643, 1672 and 1673 damaged the structure till such extent that it was considered to leave Fort Victoria and built a whole new fort on the opposite side of the bay at Laha. The position of Fort Victoria was seen as less strategic and more difficult to defend, due to the hills surrounding the structure. In the end however, the VOC judged that building a new fort was too expensive and Fort Victoria was raised from the ruins. Also throughout the eighteenth century earthquakes caused damage to the structure and subsequently repair works were conducted. During the reign of Governor Bernardus van Pleuren (1775-1785), the structure was extended to the polygonal shape, with seven bastions a hornwork and a moat, which is still partly visible today. It was after this works were finished that the fort became known as Nieuw Victoria. Close to the fort a considerable residential town has grown. In 1683 there were 770 Europeans living in the town, including the garrison; the number of Company officials in the whole Government of Amboina added up to 1070 people in the period of 1726-1730. After 1656 the Company maintained a force of around 600 soldiers in the Ambon Islands, half of whom were billeted in Victoria Castle; the other half were spread across 18 smaller strongholds. The fort has never been sieged. Without any resistance, the English took over the fort during the Napoleonic wars in 1795. Most likely the bastions and parts of the walls have been torn down after the earthquake of 1898. Also American bombardments during the second world war caused heavy damage. What remains are parts of the walls facing the bay and the hornwork. The gate has been restored several times. Within the fort, the eighteenth century powderstorage within the half-bastion Zeelandia and a room within bastion Groningen are still intact. Other buildings are from more recent date. The area still has a military function, being used today by the Indonesian army.

Surveyor Johannes Listing designed the pentagonal stone redoubt, which served as an additional fortification guarding the road between the city of Batavia and the border fort Angke (Nieuwendam). The redoubt stood on the south side of the junction between the Kali Krokot and the Bacherachtsgracht. - De Vijfhoek was renewed but not substantially changed during the rebellion of Bantam (1750-1754). It was demolished in 1811 on order of Governor General Willem Daendels (1808-1811) Today there are no visible remains of the redoubt.

The town Nossa Senhora da Conceição, nowadays called Vila Velha, held out for quite some time when the WIC attempted to conquer the region in the early 1630s. The Dutch were forced to construct a variety of siege works around it. They first constructed a redoubt on the beach to protect the people that built Fort Orange and further to the north a fortified camp (see documentation, and Nationaal Archief, inv. nr 4.AANW_1417) The Portuguese even mounted a rescue attempt at the end of 1632 led by the Neapolitan commander Bagnuolo, which was repelled by the Dutch.

In 1638 governor Johan Ottens ordered the construction of a fort on the most northern of the three islands of the Nusatelu-group on the northwest coast of Ambon, in order to control the strait between Ambon and Seram. A small triangular redoubt was built, garrisoned by a corporal with eight soldiers who had four small canons to their disposal. During the 1651 Ternate revolt against the VOC, the fort was looted and burnt. After the repression of the revolt by governor Arnold de Vlaming van Outshoorn, the fort was re-occupied by the Dutch. After the decision was made to reduce the cost of maintaining the forts of Ambon in 1697 it was no longer permanently occupied. The fort was probably used as a lookout post until 1762, when it was looted and burned by Papuan people. Currently only remains of this triangle shaped walls of the fort can be traced amidst the bushes.

The fort was to the stream that there sprang also called 'Santosa'.    - Fort Kotanaka is owned by the family of the sultan. The fort is built of natural and brick with as adhesive a mixture of lime and sand. At the recent renovation, the original steps and walls were covered with imitation-stone reliefs made of cement.

One of the obligations of the treaty of Giyanti, which in 1755 divided the empire of Martaram, was the construction of a VOC fort in the new capital Yogyakarta. The sultan paid for the construction. Sultan Hamangkubuwono I (1749-1792) tried to stall the building of the fort, located just 400 meter from his kraton. In 1765 the construction started, but it was not until 1790 that fort Rustenburg (Castle of Rest) was completed. It was a square fort with four bastions and surrounded by a moat. There was enough space inside the fort to house 500 soldiers. In 1811 the British conquered Java. Tensions grew between lieutenant Governor James Stamford Raffles and the sultan of Yogyakarta. On 17 June 1812 Raffles arrived with his army in Yogyakarta. Negotiations had no success. After the outbreak of the hostilities the artillery of fort Rusteburg fought a duel with the canons in the kraton. As a result, a powderhouse in each of the forts. On 20 June British troops stormed and occupied the Kraton. After the return of the Dutch in 1820 new tensions arose, which led to the outbreak of the Java War on 25 July 1825. Six days later Ratu (queen) Agung fled to the fort with her young grandson, sultan Hamengkubowono V. The supporters of Dipponegoro started a siege of the kraton and the fort, which ended with the arrival of general Hendrik Merkus de Kock and his army on September, 25. After the war the name of the fort was changed in Vredeburg (Castle of peace). Following severe damage after an earthquake in 1867 major repairs were undertaken. The fort remained in use by the army, and in the 20th century was used by the Japanese (as a prison, 1942-1944), the army of the Indonesian Republic (1945-1948), Dutch paratroopers (Dec. 1948 – May 1949), and the Indonesian Army (1949-1980). It is now the National museum of the Struggle, which is dedicated to the war of independence. The buildings of the fort are in a good condition. In 2014 the ditch of fort, which was filled with earth, was excavated

In 1641, the colonial government decided to build “a small redoubt at as little expense as possible” for that purpose. It is unlikely that the plan was carried out, as there are no further references to it throughout the 1640s.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- In 1656, following the 1655 Peach War, new plans for a fort emerged. Hendrick van der Capelle, absentee patroon of Staten Island, ordered captain Adrian Post “to erect a fort on said island pursuant to the order sent over, into which he and [the colonists] can retire in case of another such hostile attack on the part of the Indians.” This suggests that Van der Capelle furnished captain Post with specific instructions as to how the fort was to be built. Yet the plan appears to have been aborted when the danger of Indian attacks abated. Further colonization of Staten Island stalled until the issue of ownership was resolved. From 1661 onwards the island was settled under the direct jurisdiction of the West India Company and efforts to defend the island were again taken up. In 1662, the colonists were protected by a small garrison of six soldiers and a year later the Amsterdam directors urged Stuyvesant to take proper care of the defence of the mouth of the Hudson River, although they later admitted that their instructions were based on incorrect information. Nevertheless, in April 1664, Stuyvesant reported back that the problem had to some extent been taken care of: both New Utrecht and the as yet unnamed village on Staten Island were previous summer against an attack by wild barbarians provided with suitable blockhouses which are built by putting beam upon beam and for their better defence are each furnished with two or three light pieces, of which one or two are stone pieces; the hamlet on Staten Island, being the weakest and too far to be assisted in time, is enforced with ten soldiers for its greater safety. \t\t\t\t- At the end of the eighteenth century the location just behind Signal Hill was used for other fortifications, which gradually developed into the complex now named Fort Wadsworth. The village, later named Oude Dorp (Old Town), was located a few hundred meters to the south, at South Beach, probably close to Ocean Avenue.

Initially 'Barricade Wantrouw' (meaning distrust in Dutch) at Tumalehu village on Manipa island would have been a small wooden stronghold. In 1641 a small stone fortification was built where the deputy merchant Johan Comens was stationed. His main duty was to collect and store the cloves. In 1644 the defenses where upgraded under governor Gerard Demmer (1642–1647) when a 13 meter high blockhouse was built here. Five years later a one and a half meter high stone wall surrounding the blockhouse was added. The VOC made sure no more cloves where produced than needed for their trade and destroyed clove trees to control their monopoly position. Needless to say this harmed relations with the local population, which started a rebellion in march 1651. During the uprising the local peopled succeeded in taking over the redoubt and killed and destroyed everyone and everything. In June governor Arnold de Vlaming van Outshoorn arrived in June with 5 ships and 370 soldiers. While the local people fled to the mountain, he had all villages and plantations on Manipa Island destroyed. Without food many of the people that had fled died of hunger. Despite the island was no longer of big importance to the VOC, a new wooden fort was erected west of Tumalehu, which would eventually again be built-up in stone. Attacks staged against the few VOC soldiers guarding the post remained common, over the years many people lost their lives. February 17, 1674. a fierce earthquake caused great damage to the fort, destroying also the moat and the many houses around the fort. In 1768 the fort was reported to be in a very bad state of repair and in 1785 it even partly collapsed. Under Governor Bernardus van Pleuren (1775–1785) the blockhouse was rebuilt once more and new ramparts were built following the design of Captain Gabriel Nicolaas van Guericke. The remains of this can still be seen today. The main blockhouse structure and the entrance gate which was part of the surrounding walls are overgrown, but still largely intact. On the inside of the main gate, above the arch, a carving of a male figure in traditional European clothes flanked by stylized flowers is still visible.

Batavia Castle, one century after its construction, was now so far from the shore that it could no longer be used as a coastal battery. In 1742 governor General Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff (1743-1750) proposed the construction of a battery on a sandbank before the mouth of the Grote Rivier. The work started in 1745. The hulls of old ships were sunk into the mud as the foundation of the fort. It turned out that that this foundation was not strong enough. The original design was changed and in 1750 the construction of a smaller fort started. The problems with the foundation continued and in 1776 this fort was demolished. The decision was taken to build a smaller battery at the west end of the entrance of the Grote Rivier. In 1778 the engineer L. Lusom made a design of a new design of the land curtain of the Waterkasteel, but it wasn't executed. - In 1819 the government decided to abandon the Waterkasteel, but this was never actually done. In 1840 the old fort was seen as an important part of the coastal defences of the city. In times of war the artillery was brought from the arsenal and a garrison of 30 soldiers and four gunners were stationed at the battery. In 1852 the Waterkasteel was classified as a 3rd class defence work, which means against a native enemy. - After the construction of the new coastal defences of Batavia in 1870 the old battery Waterkasteel was abandoned and one year later demolished. The main part of the site of the fort was dug away during the improvement of the Havenkanaal. (Pelabuhan Sunda Kelapa).

The fort stood on the junction of the road along the Kali Sontar and the road between between the forts Antjol and Jacatra. It was a stone redoubt with two diagonal bastions. It is also known as Dwars in de weg (across the road) because it was situated across the road along the Sontar. Wilgenburg stood near the bridge over the kali. It was demolished in 1809 by order of Governor General Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811) - There are no no visible remains. On the modern map of Jakarta the site of Wilgenburg is at the intersection of Jalan Sawah Besar and Jalan Hidup Pademangan 4-5.

In April 1624, Nicolaes van Wassenaer reported: “They also placed a fort which they named 'Wilhelmus' on Prince's Island, heretofore called Murderer's Island; it is open in front, and has a curtain in the rear and is garrisoned by sixteen men for the defence of the river below.” Although the two islands mentioned by Van Wassenaer do not occur on early maps, an anonymous map of ca. 1630 provides the name “Willems Rivier” for the upper reaches of the Delaware. On this basis, C.A. Weslager presumed that Fort Wilhelmus was located on this river, even though Van Wassenaer's information is immediately preceded by a reference to the building Fort Orange on the Hudson River. Other sources indicate that the Walloon families arriving in New Netherland in 1624 were spread out over four locations, one of which is named as “the High Island, situated about 25 miles up the South River, below the first falls.” This island (identified as Burlington Island) is considered to be the location of Fort Wilhelmus, which was intended to be the main headquarters of New Netherland. For about two years, a fortification served to protect a small group of colonists, consisting of two families and eight men, before the settlers were moved to Manhattan in 1626 in order to better withstand a feared attack by Native Americans. An additional argument in favor of abandoning Fort Wilhelmus was that the Delaware River froze solid during the winter, leaving the outpost inaccessible and isolated. Also, Fort Orange was much more important to the fur trade, even though the Hudson River froze solid as well. - In the 1890s, Charles Conrad Abbott conducted excavations on Burlington Island. The 196 artifacts he unearthed are now part of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Listed under the provenience “Dutch Trader's House,” they include shards of pottery roof tiles, red pottery pipe fragments, metal nails, glass fragments, glass beads, as well as faunal remains, and artifacts of Native American make. There is some doubt as to whether these finds, for which a mid seventeenth-century dating has been suggested, are connected with the 1620s fort on the lower end of the island, or rather with a 1650s trading house, when it was known as Matinnekonk Island. Later, in the twentieth century, Burlington Island was used as a sand and gravel quarry, which created a large lake in the middle of the island. Even so it is possible that remains of Fort Wilhelmus have survived on the southernmost tip of the island.

The kraton (palace) of Yogyakarta is surrounded by two defensive walls. The Cepuri is the inner wall and the Baluwarti the outer wall. The construction in 1785 of the Baluwarti (the name derives from the Portuguese word 'baluarte' meaning bulwark) was an initiative of crown prince Adipati Anom, the crown prince of sultan Hamengkubuwono I. The construction of the outer defensive wall was a reaction to the building of the Dutch fort Vredeburg north of the kraton. The baluwarti is circa five kilometers long and has a bastion at each of the four corners. The wall of red brick is two to six meters thick and four to six meters high. On the top of the wall is a passage that connects the four bastions on the rampart. The baluwarti was surrounded by a moat. The construction of the wall was marked by a symbolic ornament in the form of 'suryasengkala' the 'Paninggaling Kawicakranan Salingga Bathara' which means the year 1785. There were five entrance gates with draw bridges over the moat: Tarunasura or Wijilan gate on the northeast side, Jagasura or Ngasem gate on the northwestern side, the Jagabaya or Tamansari gate on the west side, and Madyasura, Tambakbaya or Gondomanan gate in the east and Nirboyo or Gadhing gate on the south side. In November 1809, Adipati Anom was crowned and given the title 'Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono II'. Adipati Anom then fortified the fort further by enlarging its bastions by 5 to 6 meters, as a precaution against possible attacks from Dutch army under Governor General Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811). In 1810 the Governor General came to Yogyakarta, deposed the sultan, and installed his son, Hamengkubuwono III. In 1811 the British occupied Java. Hamengkubuwono II was reinstated as king and his son reverted back to crown prince. The relations between the king and Lieutenant Governor James Stamford Raffles were as bad as his relation with the Dutch. On June 17, 1812 Raffles came to Yogyakarta with an army. Negotiations had no success. After the outbreak of the hostilities the artillery of fort Vredeburg fought a duel with the canons in the kraton. The powder house in the northeast bastion of the Bulwarti exploded. On 20 June British troops stormed the breach in the wall and the north gate and occupied the kraton. Hamengkubuwono II was exiled to Penang and his son became sultan. Today a part of the southern wall and three of the four bastions of Baluwarti remain. The demolished north east bastion was never rebuilt. The streets along the east, north, west and part of the south sides became a residential area. Most houses are attached to the fortification wall.

The VOC first built a fortification on the sand bar in front of the Taiwan Bay in 1623, called fort Oranje, but abandoned it again in early 1624. The fort was reoccupied and rebuilt in the fall of that same year, after the VOC had been forced to withdraw from the Penghu Islands and instead aimed its efforts to obtain a good post for regular trade with China on Taiwan. In 1625 the fort was rechristened Provintia (not to be confused with the fort built in 1653 across the bay, which had the same name); two years later still it got its defniitive name, fort Zeelandia. - Initially a straightforward square fort with four bastions, fort Zeelandia was renovated and extended several times to become the great fortification with lower and upper castle. It did, however, not stand up to the 9 month siege by the Chinese warlord Koxinga, and was surrendered to him in January 1662.

Predecessing the fort of which remains are still visible today, probably two earlier VOC forts have stood on the west coast of Oma island. In 1626 Governor Jan van Gorkum commissioned a small fort to be built near Oma village. It was, however, both badly constructed and situated because it could be easily shot at from the mountains around it, and it was too far from fresh water sources. In 1655 a new fort was built at Haruku village. Drawings by François Valentijn and Isaak de Graaf show us a blockhouse, very much like the blockhouses build along the Hitu coast. The stone walls of the defence tower would have been over ten meters high and one and a half meters thick. Surrounding the blockhouse stood a square structure of palisades. These wooden fencing was later replaced by a coral stone wall of around one and a half meter high. In 1817 the fort had deteriorated but because of the rebellion that broke up in the region, it was hastily repaired and withstood the attack. A year later however, a heavy gale and storm lashed from the sea, and destroyed the fort. The current remains mostly date back from works done from around 1822. From then on the fort became known as Fort Nieuw Zeelandia. From 1862 onwards soldiers were no longer stationed at the fort. It became the dwelling place of inspectors who had the duty to supervise and oversee the harvesting of cloves. The landside of the fort with the gate and the southeastern half-bastion bastion is still mostly intact. On the seaside the structure has suffered more from the destructive forces of the sea. Within the former fort locals have built homes between the ruinous walls.

The uncompleted English Fort Willoughby fell into Dutch hands in 1667 and was definitively handed over to Abraham Crijnssen in May 1668. Its construction was completed under his interim-administration up to 1669 and under Governor Cornelis van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck after 1683 an earthen outer fort was added to a fort now known as Zeelandia. In subsequent decades, both the construction and situation of the fort proved problematic, and numerous plans were suggested for its improvement, overhaul and even its removal.

The redoubt, which was designed by surveyor Johannes Listingh, controlled the traffic along the Antjolse vaart and ships entering and leaving the river. In 1667 the earthwork was replaced by the square brick battery Post Antjol. A sentry post controlled the traffic over the road along the canal. The road along the Antjolse Vaart could be closed with a pagger (wooden defense work). The fort became even more important after the opening of the toll bridge over Antjol river in 1738, which made it easier to go from Batavia to Tandjoeng Priok. In 1740 the fort played a role in the defence against Chinese rebels on their way to Batavia, who tried to cross the bridge. - Around 1750 Antjol became a real fort when it was enlarged with three bastions and on the fourth corner the already existing battery. Inside the fortification stood the houses of the post holder and the master gunner and the military guard house. - The fort was demolished in 1809-1810 on order of Governor general Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811). There are no visible remains today.

In 1665 veroverde admiraal Michiel de Ruyter het fort Kormantijn op de Engelsen, die het rond 1631 hadden gesticht. Na de verovering werd het op de heuvel gesitueerde fort verbouwd en herdoopt met de naam 'Amsterdam'. De plaats Kormantijn, gelegen tussen Elmina en Apam aan de Goudkust, stond bekend als een handelsplaats waar de commercie nog al eens schommelde. Goud en slaven, die ook wel Coromantese of Cormantins werden genoemd, waren de belangrijkste exportproducten. De Nederlanders konden in Kormantijn geen recht spreken, met als gevolg dat de plaatselijke bestuurders het hen wel eens moeilijk maakten. Soms blokkeerden zij de handelswegen en eisten ze grote sommen geld. Volgens Bosman, die de plaats in 1704 beschreef, was het niet de moeite waard om het fort te vernieuwen aangezien de handel niet genoeg op zou leveren om de onkosten te dekken.

De meest oostelijk gelegen grote Nederlandse handelspost aan de Goudkust was fort Crevecoeur in Accra. De contacten tussen de WIC en dit gebied bestonden al sinds 1624. Pas in 1647 werd hier een handelspost gesticht. In datzelfde jaar ontving de Compagnie, tegen betaling van goud aan de plaatselijke vorst, een monopolie op de handel in Accra. Twee jaar later werd het kantoor omgebouwd tot een fort. Het eerder genoemde monopolie bleek alleen op papier te bestaan, want al snel konden ook de Denen en de Engelsen zich vestigen in Accra. Vooral de handel in slaven was voor de WIC-post in Accra van groot belang. Een goede band met de Ashanti was cruciaal voor de handel van de West-Indische Compagnie in dit gebied. De Ashanti is een verzamelnaam van verschillende rijken in het achterland van de Goudkust die zich in het eind van de 17de eeuw hadden verenigd tot een confederatie. De voornaamste handelsroute liep van Accra aan de kust tot Kumasi, de hoofdstad van de Ashanti, in het binnenland.

Aden was Yemen's main port in the 16th century. It was largely a transhipment port. The famous gum arabic was produced in the dry hinterland. Aden also produced incense. During the 17th century the town was eclipsed by the rise of Mocca, a centre for the coffee trade. The town walls remained intact but Aden's beautiful town centre became run down. Between 1614 and 1620 the VOC briefly operated a trading office in Aden. The aim was to sell spices in Yemen, so generating the cash required to by goods in the north-west Indian town of Surat. But trade was hindered by the struggle of the Arabic Yemenites against their Turkish rulers. The VOC had little success selling its products. Nevertheless, the Company continued sending ships to Aden after 1620.

Affogados is tegenwoordig één van de vele wijken van de grote stad Recife, de hoofdstad van de Braziliaanse staat Pernambuco. In de periode dat de WIC actief aanwezig was op de kusten van Brazilië, werkten de WIC-bestuurders van dit gebied aan de uitbreiding van het dorp Recife (nu het historische centrum van de stad) en stichtten zij op een nabijgelegen eiland de stad Mauritsstad. Ten zuiden van Mauritsstad lag het plaatsje Affogados. Deze naam is afkomstig van een riviertje genaamd Rio dos Affogados (ofwel Effogados) met twee zijtakken.Het veroveren van Affogados was van belang gezien haar strategische ligging; het lag tussen Arraial do Bom Jesus (waar de Portugezen hun hoofdkwartier hadden gesticht tijdens de oorlog tegen de Nederlanders) en Cabo St. Agostinho, een belangrijke ankerplaats voor grote schepen. Toen de Nederlanders deze streek rond 1632-33 innamen, veroverden zij ook verschillende Portugese forten en redoutes. De belangrijkste vestiging was fort Prins Willem. Samen met fort Frederick Hendrick, waarmee fort Willem verbonden was via een dijk en een kanaal, vormden deze fortificatiewerken een belangrijke verdedigingslijn. Het fort diende ook tot bescherming van de weg naar de Varzea, een vlakte waar zich de grootste concentratie engenhos (suikermolens) bevond. Door de bouw van fort Willem kon ook de passage tussen de Affogados en het eiland Anthonij Vaz (het eiland waarop de Nederlanders Mauritsstad bouwden) goed worden verdedigd. Andere forten waren redoute Kijck in de Pot, fort Barretta, vier redouten zonder naam ten westen van Mauritsstad en het verdedigingswerk Aemilia bij Passo Emilia, dat dichtbij fort Frederik Hendrik lag.

Agathon, in het huidige Nigeria, lag op een kleine heuvel en was gelegen aan de rivier Benin (ook Rio Formoso genoemd). Het was een belangrijke handelspost voor de WIC. Rond het jaar 1717 kocht de WIC hier stoffen in, die aan de Goud- en Slavenkust werden geruild tegen producten die de Compagnie meer opleverden. De bekendste stoffen hadden de naam 'Benijnse panen', een soort lendendoeken. In 1718-1719 bracht het comptoir 31.092 pond aan ivoor op, een opmerkelijk grote hoeveelheid.

Even before the VOC opened a trading post there in 1621, company officials used to journey from Surat to Agra, which lay some 800 kilometres further inland, to buy indigo there. Finest quality indigo was obtained from the growers themselves, in the villages to the south-west of the town. The VOC shipped a large proportion of the indigo from Agra to the Dutch Republic, where it was used in the textile industry. The indigo trade came to a halt in the early 18th century as a result of political unrest in the north of India. In 1720 the trading post closed. Besides indigo, silk from Bengal and all kinds of cotton were available at the market in Agra. The Agra trading post had a reputation for fraud. The town was six weeks' journey from Surat, so inspectors from Batavia rarely visited. The Company's employees took full advantage of their relative freedom to earn fortunes from private trade and fiddling the accounts. It was generally considered that anyone who failed to return from Agra fabulously rich must have lived in very high style indeed.

'Agter de Steenbergen aan Baai Fals' ('Behind the Steenberg on False Bay') was the name of a cattle post situated on the eastern side of the Steenberg mountains. On the western side the Company maintained a second outpost named 'Aan de Steenberg'. The first mention of the 'Agter de Steenberg' settlement in VOC documents dates from 1672. The settlement served a dual function, acting both as a surveillance post and a cattle post.

Ahmadabad was a large town that attracted merchants from all over the globe. Its markets traded indigo, cotton fabrics and yarns, silk, diamonds and saltpetre. No import or export duties were charged at Ahmadabad, but merchants were required to make regular visits with gifts to the town's governor in his fortified castle. In 1617 the VOC opened a base in Ahmadabad. In Ahmadabad the Company purchased indigo from Sirkhej, silk - which it sold in Java - and diamonds from the Golkonda mines. As a result of the decline of the Mogul empire in the early 18th century, trade diminished and the road from Ahmadabad to Surat became increasingly dangerous. As a result the VOC closed its base in Ahmadabad in 1744.

The Bandanese island of Ai was an important producer of nutmeg. The murder of the VOC admiral Pieter Willemsz verhoeff in 1609 on the island of Bandaneira and subsequent events eventually precipitated a war between the VOC and Ai. The VOC decided to conquer the island because of the lively spice trade. The English East India Company also traded there. The first invasion in 1615 was an abject failure and the VOC was driven back. The second attempt in 1616 did succeed. The population managed to save itself by fleeing to other islands. To prevent the island from being retaken a fort was built with the fitting name Revenge. The VOC immediately repopulated the island, mostly Asians, to continue the cultivation of nutmeg. In 1621 the nutmeg forest was parceled up by the VOC and distributed to burghers, free citizens. The parcels were called 'perken', their owners 'perkeniers.' The perkeniers were obliged to sell all of their production to the VOC. Half of these parcels was distributed to Asians, half to European colonists. Most of the work on the parcels was done by slaves.

Adjarhadja, now known as Airhaji, lay on the western coast of Sumatra, close to Indrapura. The VOC's authority over the West Coast of Sumatra extended from the settlement at Adjarhadja through to Baros in the north. Like the majority of the VOC settlements on this coast, Adjarhadja was a small trading and observation post. The West Coast of Sumatra not only produced large amounts of pepper but also gold. The Company managed to establish a foothold through working together with the local rulers and monarchs. They applied to the Company for help in repelling the Sultan of Atjeh, who wished to rule over the entire island. In return for the entire pepper production of the region at fixed prices, the VOC pledged to protect the rulers of these regions.

Volgens een verdrag van 1688 zou de WIC het fort aan de Brandenburg Compagnie terug moeten geven. Dit gebeurde echter pas in 1690. In het begin van de 18de eeuw wisselden de eigenaars elkaar af, in de loop van de 18de eeuw werd het Nederlands bezit en vonden diverse verbouwingen aan het fort plaats.

The VOC rented a trading post here, initially in the years 1645 to 1646. Several years later the Company returned, in 1651. After that the Company sporadically rented a trading post in Basra. In the period spanning 1723 to 1752 it rented a trading station on and off. But the trading station was abandoned in 1753 due to problems with the local authorities. In 1753 the head of the trading station, Theo von Kniphausen, was accused of maintaining relationships with Moslim women. He protested innocence and was released after a large sum of money had been paid. Von Kniphausen sailed to Batavia where he was able to convince the governor-general to take a hard line and to evade all future problems of 'blackmail and vexation' by setting up a trading post on Kark. He then came back, blockaded the Shatt al-Arab and forced the return of the money and closed down the trading posts in Basra and Bushire. After 1740 Basra emerged as the most important staging post of the VOC in the Gulf. But a number of decades later the roles were reversed once more and it was the VOC's turn to cede to the English.

The VOC base in Mocha, today known as Al-Mukha, was opened in 1621. Trade there was severely curtailed by the volatile political situation. At first the VOC was subject to the Turkish overlords, later to the Arabic Yemenites, now freed from Turkish rule. The VOC attempted to force trade by violent means, to no avail. This foreign outpost only began to flourish in the early 18th century, boosted by the demand in Europe for Mocha's coffee. Until 1707 Mocha fell under the jurisdiction of the head office in Surat, but thereafter it came under Batavia as an independent base. In 1739 it was closed, although the VOC continued to sail to Mocha. Because the VOC ships coming to Mocha for coffee were dependent on the monsoon to sail, trade was slow to flourish. Arab traders drove the price up, knowing the ships needed to leave as soon as the wind turned favourable. However once the Company had established a permanent base, it was able to negotiate more attractive prices. Among the goods the VOC exchanged for Mocha coffee were spices, a narcotic called 'quat', and porcelain coffee cups.

In de huidige stad Albany, voorheen Beverwijck, hebben de Nederlanders in het begin van de zeventiende eeuw drie forten gesticht. Zij noemden deze plaats Beverwijck, naar de bevervellen die zij er kochten van de Indianen. Het eerste fort werd rond 1613 door de Nederlanders op een eiland (waarschijnlijk op Castle Island) in de mond van de rivier de Hudson gebouwd. Het was een klein fort en de eerste handelspost in 'het Nieuwe land'. De bouwers van het fort waren bemanningsleden van de schepen Fortuyn en Tijger. Het fort, Nassau genaamd, heeft niet lang bestaan; al in 1617 werd het eiland geteisterd door overstromingen waardoor het fort vernield en verlaten werd. Dat zou dan ook de aanleiding geweest kunnen zijn tot het bouwen van een nieuw fort, met dezelfde naam. Dit tweede fort Nassau zou rond 1618 aan de westoever van de Hudson zijn opgericht. Het derde fort, fort Oranje, werd ook aan de westoever van de Hudson neergezet, aan de kruising van de Hudson en de Mohawk rivier. Het zou ongeveer een kilometer ten noorden van fort Nassau gelegen moeten hebben. In eerste instantie was het fort een vierkant gebouw met bastions. Het fort was van hout gemaakt en omsingeld door een gracht. Toen het fort rond 1647 door overstromingen van de rivier werd beschadigd, besloot Peter Stuyvesant, directeur-generaal van Nieuw-Nederland, het opnieuw op te richten. Nu werd fort Oranje van steen gemaakt.Fort Oranje diende lange tijd als bestuurlijk centrum van de Nederlanders. Daarnaast was het fort de inkoopplaats van pelzen. In het midden van de zeventiende eeuw werden jaarlijks zo'n 46.000 pelzen ingekocht. De pelzen werden geleverd door Indianen die naar de rivier kwamen. De onrusten met de Mohawk Indianen en de wens een meer centraal gelegen handelsplaats te verkrijgen, waren redenen voor verplaatsing van het centrum: Beverwijck moest plaatsmaken voor een andere plaats. Zo werd in 1625 de stichting van fort Amsterdam op het eiland Man (Manhatten) een feit en hiermee Nieuw-Amsterdam. In 1664, toen een groot Engelse vloot voor Nieuw-Amsterdam (nu New York) verscheen, besefte Peter Stuyvesant dat hun macht te groot was voor een veilig behoud van de Nederlandse vestingen. Binnen een week werden alle Nederlandse vestingen in Nieuw-Nederland overgegeven aan de Engelsen. In 1667, bij de vrede van Breda, werd het nieuwe Engelse bezit van Nieuw-Nederland herbevestigd, echter Amsterdamse kooplieden bleven nog lange tijd handel drijven met dit gebied.

Al in 1640 zond de WIC met regelmaat dienaren naar Allada. De plaats Allada, 35 km van de slavenkust in het binnenland gelegen, was de hoofdstad van het koninkrijk Dahomey. Volgens Bosman, die een uitgebreide beschrijving opstelde van dit gebied, werd Allada ook wel Groot Ardra genoemd. Er bestond ook een 'Klein Ardra', een plaats aan de Slavenkust die ook wel Offra, Ardre, Arda of Cleen Arder genoemd. Uit een rapport van 1660 zou blijken dat er sprake zou zijn van een vestiging van de West-Indische Compagnie in Allada. Allada was een belangrijke doorvoer post voor de slavenhandel. Ook Ratelband noemt de plaats Allada of 'Groot Arder', als hoofdstad van het rijk Arder. Arder stond, als tweede plek na Elmina, bekend om haar slavenmarkt. Volgens Ratelband had de WIC in 1645 nog geen handelspost in Allada, maar alleen een opslagplaats.

According to Valentijn, a contemporary author, there was little of interest to be found on Amblaauw a tiny islet that lay south east of the island of Buru. According to Valentijn there were 15 villages, of which nine had a VOC guard post. Valentijn further remarks on the island population's skill in shipbuilding. The fact that the island was so remote from the important trading centres made it an unattractive prospect. But because it lay on the route to Maccassar and maintained strong links with the latter, the VOC in the mid 17th century built a redoubt on Amblaauw using locally supplied materials. Amblaauw was dogged by war, particularly around 1664 when the VOC was in dispute with Maccassar on Sulawesi. The ruler of Maccassar backed the rebels in the Moluccan islands in their uprising against the Company.

In 1605 the VOC fleet, commanded by Admiral Steven Van der Hagen, arrived in the Bay of Ambon. The Company took the Portuguese Castle Victoria, with its garrison of 600 men, without bloodshed. The conquest was achieved so easily that it was later described as a miracle. The first governor of Ambon was Frederik de Houtman, who resided there from 1605 to 1611. Ambon quickly expanded to become a major city. By 1683 it boasted a European population of 770, most of them soldiers. Besides the governor, there were 33 officials concerned with the trade in cloves, mace and nutmeg. These spices were exported to Holland through Batavia. Whenever there was a glut, surplus products were sold in India and Persia. The islands administered from Ambon had their own fleet of rowing vessels called cora-coras. Once a year the governor would order all the cora-coras to assemble for a tour of inspection through his territory. This illustration shows one such voyage by the governor; his ship is flying the Dutch flag. The VOC had but one objective in running Ambon; to secure a monopoly of the clove trade. Innumerable agreements were signed with local rulers, with the aim of ensuring that all the cloves went to the VOC alone. The local population could have sold their products for better prices to foreign traders; but when they did so the Company punished the villages by burning their harvest. The task of the governor in Ambon was a difficult one: he had to protect the group of islands falling under Ambon's jurisdiction and to ensure the smooth running of the valuable spice trade. Besides the countless wars with the English, Spanish and French, who also had their sights set on these fertile islands, the Company had to contend with the local Islamic and Christian rulers. National courts were set up for both religions, at which the governor and councillors pronounced judgement together with the rulers, once a fortnight. Prior to the founding of Batavia in 1619, the VOC's governor-generals were more or less peripatetic. They took up residence alternately in Fort Victoria on Ambon and in Fort Oranje on Ternate. After this period, Ambon became a 'gouvernement'.

In 1624 the VOC set up a base on the island of Formosa, today known as Taiwan. There it built Fort Zeelandia on a small peninsula off the coast, level with where An-Ping is today. From here the VOC hoped to gain access to trade on the Chinese mainland. But China showed little interest. The Company's idea that it would be able to achieve its desired aim through the use of force proved to be a miscalculation. In the 17th century the VOC's aggressive stance worked to its disadvantage. Even so, Zeelandia soon proved to be a promising trading base. Chinese merchants brought porcelain, silk and gold to the base, and when the VOC found that Formosa had a plentiful supply of deer, a lucrative export trade in deer hides to Japan began. Soon the mainland of Formosa was brought under the control of Zeelandia. Alongside the fort the town of Zeelandia grew up, with a weighing-house, a market hall, a hospital and an orphanage. Formosa became the VOC's first real colony in Asia. Formosa functioned as a 'gouvernement' or colonial department from 1624 to 1662. The governor was based at Fort Zeelandia in An-Ping. The bulk of the VOC's income on Formosa came from trade with Chinese merchants. In the main the VOC sold spices and silver, and received porcelain, gold and silver in exchange. In addition the island itself became an increasingly important source of income; growing numbers of Chinese refugees from the mainland began cultivating sugar cane, indigo and rice. The VOC traded sugar in India, Persia and Europe. Eventually, almost 40 percent of Zeelandia's total income came from taxes that the VOC levied on Chinese merchants, and from land leases, hunting and fishing rights. The VOC's regime on Formosa came to an end in 1661-1662, as an indirect result of the fall of the Ming-dynasty and the resulting civil war in China. At the end of April 1661, the ming-loyalist warlord Koxinga sought a safe refuge for his troops and for this purpose invaded Taiwan, landing his troops at An-Ping. He isolated the Dutch in their forts and soon gained control of much of the west coast of the island. Fort Zeelandia was besieged and held out for another 10 months, but had to surrender in January 1662. This brought an end to the Dutch presence in An-Ping.

Christopher Columbus named the island 'Antigua' in 1493 in honour of the 'Virgin of the Old Cathedral' (Spanish: La Virgen de la Antigua) found in Seville Cathedral in southern Spain. On his 1493 voyage, honouring a vow, he named many islands after different aspects of St. Mary, including Montserrat and Guadaloupe. In 1632, a group of English colonists left St. Kitts to settle on Antigua. Sir Christopher Codrington, an Englishman, established the first permanent European settlement. From that point on, Antigua history took a dramatic turn. Codrington guided development on the island as a profitable sugar colony. For a large portion of Antigua history, the island was considered Britain's 'Gateway to the Caribbean'. It was located on the major sailing routes among the region's resource-rich colonies. Lord Horatio Nelson, a major figure in Antigua history, arrived in the late 18th century to preserve the island's commercial shipping prowess. Sugar became Antigua's main crop in about 1674, when Christopher Codrington (c 1640-1698) settled at Betty's Hope plantation. He came from Barbados, bringing the latest sugar technology with him. This resulted in their importing slaves to work the sugar cane crops.

Fort Leydsaemheyt in Apam, gelegen aan de Goudkust tussen de plaatsen Cape Coast en Accra in, werd gebouwd in 1697. Het was een klein fort met twee verdiepingen. Het fort had haar naam te danken aan de continue aanvallen van de plaatselijke stammen. Aanvankelijk kwam de slavenhandel zeer goed op gang, in 1705 verzamelde de WIC wel 900 slaven uit Apam en omgeving. Oorlogen tussen de Akyem en de Akwamu stammen resulteerden in een vermindering van de slavenopbrengst. De Akyem, ook vijandig ten opzichte van de Nederlanders, vielen in 1811 het fort aan en vernietigden het grotendeels. In de 20ste eeuw werd het fort onder meer gebruikt als postkantoor en politiebureau.

Het eiland Appa lag ten oosten van Offra, aan de Slavenkust. Hier werkte Hendrik Hertog, een WIC-dienaar, die in 1732 gevlucht was voor de conflicten rond de plaats Jaquin. Op Appa liet hij een nieuw handelskantoor neerzetten. Dit kantoor moest in de plaats komen van het verwoeste kantoor van Jaquin. De vernielingen hadden van doen met de oorlogen die gaande waren tussen de plaatselijke vorsten. De vorst van Dahomey (een rijk in het binnenland van de Slavenkust) streed tegen de vorsten uit de kuststreek.Het lukte Hendrik Hertog om Appa uit te bouwen tot een belangwekkende slavenpost, met als gevolg dat besloten werd de slavenschepen in het vervolg direct op Appa af te laten koersen. Maar niet voor lang, want in 1735 besloot het bestuur van de WIC de slavenschepen naar Elmina te sturen, het hoofdkwartier van de Nederlanders aan de Goudkust, in plaats van naar Appa. Twee jaar later slaat Hertog weer op de vlucht naar het meer oostelijk gelegen Pattackerie, vanwege de angst dat nu ook Appa aangevallen zou worden. Langzaamaan wordt het de Compagnie duidelijk dat het in stand houden van de slavenhandel aan de Slavenkust steeds moeilijker wordt. Later zal deze dan ook overgelaten worden aan particuliere handelaren.

With a few interruptions, the VOC maintained a base in Arraccan from 1625 to 1665. After building a new trading post in 1653, the VOC signed an agreement with the local rulers which included an exemption for the VOC from the local toll. The slaves supplied by Arraccan were prisoners of war from Bengal. When the war between Arraccan and Bengal ended, the slave trade came to an abrupt halt. As a result, the VOC closed its trading post in Arraccan.

To strengthen its position in the hinterland surrounding Colombo, the Company built a string of forts along the River Kelani in the second half of the 17th century. Arandare was one of these. The fort's sole purpose was to frighten off the king of Kandy, but in 1695 the king captured the fort and razed it to the ground.

Armina was een van de posten aan het Surinaamse Cordonpad, dat tussen 1776 en 1778 werd opgericht. Dit pad was in wezen een stelsel van militairen posten. Het pad liep van het beginpunt aan de Suriname rivier (post Gelderland bij de Joodse Savanne) naar de rivier Commewijne en vandaar langs de Cottica kreek tot aan de zee. Het Cordonpad sloot een groot deel van de kolonie van het binnenland en het oerwoud af. Dit postenstelsel werd geïnitieerd met als doel het weglopen van vele slaven uit de plantages te voorkomen, maar ook om de plantages te beschermen tegen aanvallen van gevluchte slaven, die onder leiding van aanvoerder Boni in opstand waren gekomen. Boni was een weggelopen slaaf die in de 18de eeuw een serie opstanden in Suriname organiseerde, bekend als de Boni oorlogen. Deze vonden plaats tussen 1765 en 1793 en vormden een groot probleem voor het WIC-bestuur in het welvarende Suriname. Armina, gelegen aan de Marowijne rivier, stond bekend als een onaangename militaire post omdat het in een verlaten gebied lag. Het bestond uit een blokhuis, enkele magazijnen, officierswoningen en -verblijven. De huizen waren gemaakt van stammen en bedekt met bladeren van de pina, een palmsoort uit de omgeving. Op elke punt van de palissade was een kanon geplaatst.

The Paardenbaai (Horse Bay) was an intermediate harbor for the Curaçao trade with Venezuela. Horse Bay was frequently harassed by enemy forces. The seizure of ships meant a great loss for the Curaçao trade capital. Fort Zoutman was built in January 1798 on order of director (governor) Johan R. Lauffer.Lauffer named it after Johan Arnold Zoutman. Zoutman was rear admiral during the Dutch-English war in 1781. Theunis Lourens Vos Jansz and Adriaan Wever were appointed on February 8, 1798, as gunners of the batteries in Aruba.The most important feat of arms of the fort was beating off an English attack in 1799. In 1805, Aruba was in British hands. A Dutch effort to regain the fort on November 18 failed. Still the English left the island. The fort got its current aspect during the restoration of 1826.

Asaudi was a settlement on Hoamoal (Western Seram), a clove-producing region ruled by the <kimelaha>, the leader of Hoamoal with whom the VOC was periodically in conflict. Asaudi periodically sent out raids against the allies of the VOC in the region, and in response, was attacked and destroyed by the VOC several times over the early 17th century. During the Great Ambon War (1651-1656) it was the center of resistance against the VOC, and a base for the Makasar allies of the <kimelaha>, for an extended period. In July 1655, the VOC conquered it after a long deliberate strategy of starving the region. At the end of the war, the entire peninsula was depopulated, and the people living there forced to relocate.

Sitawaka was situated east of Colombo on the road to Kandy. Together with Hanwella it lay on the all-important route linking the mountain region with the coast. Raja Sinha, the king of Kandy, used Sitawaka as a base for his attacks on the enemy Portuguese. Towards the end of the 16th century Sitiwaka's beautiful palaces and temples were razed to the ground by Azevedo, a Portuguese general. Around 1595 the Portuguese built a small fort here. After the VOC wrested power from the Portuguese, the Company built a stronger fort not far distant from the Portuguese castle. When relations with the king of Kandy deteriorated, this fort offered protection against the armies of the king. But Sitawaka also functioned as a halfway house, offering hospitality to VOC ambassadors en route to visit the King of Kandy. Their annual visits to the King of Kandy were major undertakings due to the size of the entourage and the large number of gifts for the monarch. After the fort at Hanwella was reinforced in 1685 the Company left Sitawaka.

Ayutthaya - known as Judea during the VOC period - was the capital of the kingdom of Siam, today's Thailand. Siam was very important to the VOC, and so in 1608 the Company opened a trading post there concentrating primarily on the trade in sappan wood - which was used as dye - as well as tin and animal pelts. The VOC sold most of its pelts to Japan.In 1609 the king of Siam sent a delegation to the Dutch Republic to try and improve relations with the VOC. Although this initial meeting met with little enthusiasm from the Dutch side, the ties between the Company and Siam gradually became stronger. Indeed, in the mid-17th century the VOC even had a shipyard in Ayutthaya where a Dutch shipwright built ships on the European model, with the help of Siamese labour.In 1650 the VOC's ships seized control of the River Menam, on which Ayutthaya is situated. This enabled the Company to force the king of Siam to agree to a treaty. One of the provisions was that the Chinese were no longer to be admitted to Siamese territory; furthermore, the king was required to guarantee the free export of all animal pelts.From 1630 there was an 'opperhoofd' or supervisor resident in Ayutthaya responsible for trade in Siam. This trading post closed and reopened several times before finally closing for good in 1762.

Pattackerie, een plaats aan de Slavenkust, was het toevluchtsoord van Hendrik Hertog, de WIC-dienaar die in 1732 vanuit het verwoeste Jaquin naar het eiland Appa vertrok en van Appa naar Pattackerie. Tijdens de oorlogen tussen de verschillende vorsten aan de kust en de vorst van Dahomey (vorst van een in het binnenland gelegen rijk van de Slavenkust), maakte Hertog een verkeerde keuze. Hertog koos de kant van de vorst van Dahomey. De inmenging van Hertog in de strijd wekte de woede van een van de vorsten op, die als gevolg daarvan de WIC-post te Jaquin aanviel. De uitwijking van Jaquin naar Appa was maar een tijdelijke oplossing, aangezien Hertog ook voor een aanval op Appa vreesde. Vandaar zijn tweede vlucht naar Pattackerie. Daar aangekomen probeerde hij een fort te laten bouwen. Echter de Heren Negentien, de bewindhebbers van de WIC, besloten tot beëindiging van de investering in de Slavenkust. De slavenhandel nam er drastisch af en Hertog werd in 1738 vermoord.

Some time after 1640 the Company decided to rent a house in Bahrein for purchasing pearls. The Dutch VOC employee assigned to the task was Costerus. He was soon captured and his cargo confiscated because he had been taken for a Portuguese, who at that time were enemies of the Arabs. After the misunderstanding had been cleared up, the VOC set up a trade office in the region. However the trade proved unsuccessful. In order to maintain their hold over the pearl trade, the local traders sold their pearls for high prices. The VOC office was closed down again within a relatively short period of time.

Balasore, situated on the mouth of the Hougli River in the Bay of Bengal, was a well-known port. It had played host to the first European trading posts. The British established a base there in 1633, the French in 1674 and the Danes in 1676. The British fort was later renamed Fort William in honour of King William III. The VOC also had a trading post and a fort in Balasore. The Dutch established a presence here in 1676 on leaving Pipely. Balasore fell under the aegis of the Directorate of Bengal and functioned as a key link between the VOC trading posts in Bengal and those in Coromandel. Between 1700 and 1789 the settlement played host annually to a surgeon, and sometimes to a bookkeeper.

Company merchants often negotiated the purchase of slaves at Pipeli port. This port city was the first port of call for VOC ships in Bengal. Until 1635 the headquarters of the Company in Bengal was located at Pipeli, but because of the unhealthy climate it was decided to relocate the main base to Houghly. Pipeli remained an import and export centre for this part of Bengal.

Balsetou was a VOC guard post near to the island of Ambon. It was set up a surveillance station to supervise the clove trade. In this way the activities of the Company's European rivals - its enemies - could be monitored. It was also important to the Company as a way of monitoring the activities of the indigenous inhabitants. The idea was that the cloves grown by the people of Ambon be surrendered to the village chiefs, who in turn would supply the product to the Company.

Bandar-e Kong or Congo; The VOC never really had a trading station. However, from 1653 onwards an agent visited almost every year in order to buy pearls. In 1690 the VOC considered establishing a trading station in Congo for the purchase of pearls and gold and silver coins. But due to resistance from the Portuguese, who were intent on defending their interests in Congo, the VOC was forced to pull out of the Congo within that same year.

The town of Atjeh was the centre of a large sultanate of the same name extending into the interior of Thailand. In Atjeh itself stood the sultan's palace. The sultans took advantage of the town's natural harbour; whenever foreign ships anchored in the harbour, the sultan put up the price of pepper, Atjeh's most important product. The Company maintained a trading post in Atjeh from 1607 onwards. This post served primarily as a storage depot for pepper and tin. The pepper was grown in northern Sumatra, while the tin came from the mines of Perak, on the west coast of Malaysia, which at that time was part of the sultanate of Atjeh. Atjeh had long been a centre of trade, from which diamonds, gold, pepper and tin were shipped to other countries. During the first decade of the 17th century the Company controlled the pepper trade in Atjeh. The VOC paid for the pepper with fabrics from India, ivory and rice. However, the Company quickly lost control of the pepper trade, because it tried to sell its cotton at a higher price than the Indian traders. Indeed, relations deteriorated to such an extent that the sultan of Atjeh forbade his subjects to sell pepper to the Company. It was only at the end of the 17th century that trade in Atjeh become more profitable, when the sultan granted the pepper monopoly to the VOC. Even before the foundation of the VOC in 1602, Dutch traders had already made contact with the sultan of Atjeh. These initial meetings were far from peaceable. However, once the sultan had begun to tire of the Portuguese presence, his relations with the Company improved. He even sent two envoys to the Dutch Republic in 1602, to find out more about the political state of the Republic. These envoys were the first people from the region to visit Holland. But despite this bold overture, the Company's subsequent agreements with the sultan were not particularly successful; both parties repeatedly breached their contracts.

Great Banda, also called Lonthor after the main village, is the biggest of the Banda Islands. On this island the Bandanese produced most of the nutmeg and mace. In 1621, Great Banda was violently conquered by Governor General Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The most numerous casualties were those Bandanese who had fled to the mountains and died there of hunger and hardship. An unknown number of Bandanese left the island by boat to settle elsewhere in the region. Around 800 Bandanese were deported to Batavia. 44 orangkaja's (chiefs) suspected of plotting Coen's assassination were arrested, interrogated on the rack, sentenced to death and executed. After the conquest the Bandanese nutmeg gardens were annexed, parceled up and allotted to freeburghers. The parcels are called 'perken', their owners 'perkeniers.' The owners were required to sell their nutmeg and mace to the VOC. Labour on the 'perken' was mostly done by slaves. The perkenier system persisted until 1873.

The VOC had a trading post on the island of Banda-Neira from 1599. In 1609, Fort Nassau was constructed on the location of an earlier fortification. The construction of the fort and the murder of admiral Pieter Willemsz Verhoeff by Bandanese triggered a war between the VOC and Banda-Neira that same year. The VOC won, after which the Bandanese had to cede the island. In 1612, another fort, named Belgica, was erected on a hilltop behind fort Nassau, in order to protect it from a possible Bandanese landside attack. Fort Nassau was the seat of the 'gouvernement' Banda, which would come to consist of the Banda Islands, the Southeastern Islands and the Southwestern Islands. Banda-Neira and the other Banda Islands, were (virtually) the only place in the world where nutmeg trees grew. Between 1609 and 1621 the VOC conquered all of Banda, including the nutmeg gardens belonging to the Bandanese. In this way the VOC obtained a monopoly on nutmeg and mace. From 1621 onwards, the annexed gardens were parceled up by the VOC and allotted to freeburgers. The parcels were called 'perken', their owners 'perkeniers'. Most of the work in these 'perken' was done by slaves. The 'perkeniers' were required to sell their produce to the VOC. The 'perkenier' system was only abolished in 1873.

The VOC set up an office in Gamron, known today as Bandar Abbas, in 1623. It functioned as the head office of the Persian section. The VOC were based here from 1623 to 1659. Thereafter an overseer remained to keep an eye on the trading post for the Company until 1765. In Gamron the VOC purchased wool and attar of roses; and above all silk. Besides spices and cotton fabrics, the VOC also sold porcelain, opium and Japanese lacquer work. The shahs of Persia granted the Company trading concessions in the 17th century in exchange for military support and the opportunity to sell silk to the British as well as to the Dutch. Gamron had a relatively small garrison comprising around 20 European employees and 20 Persian staff. A new VOC lodge was built in the late 17th century, after the original building was severely damaged by earthquakes. Gamron was a highly profitable base for the VOC in the 17th century. But after the Persian kingdom fell to the Afghans in the early 18th century trade came to a standstill. In 1766 the VOC was forced to abandon its efforts in the Persian Gulf in the face of British competition.

The kingdom of Banjarmasin on the Barito River in southern Kalimantan was reputedly founded by Empu Jamatka in 1387. The capital lies on the island Tatas. The kingdom became an important source of diamonds, bezoar stones, and dragon's blood (a plant extract) but was dependent on Java for the supply of rice and was tributary to the Javanese states of Majapahit, Demak, and Mataram, respectively. Its ruler converted to Islam around 1520, and the sultanate received many refugees from the north coast of Java after the fall of Surabaya to Mataram in 1625. In the 17th century pepper, gambier (used for chewing betel), gold, and rattan became major trading commodities, attracting Chinese traders as well as the Dutch and English East India Companies. Both the Dutch and the British attempted to enforce monopolies in the port, but the various agreements with sultans were unenforceable as economic and political power was concentrated in the hands of powerful pepper planters. The Dutch were forced to leave in 1669. The British closed their trading post in 1707. On request of the sultan the VOC sent ships to Banjarmassin again from 1726 onwards. Both parties signed a treaty in 1733, in which the Company got the monopoly on the pepper trade and the obligation to protect the sultan against his enemies. The monopoly was often eluded by smugglers. In 1747 Governor General Gustav Willem van Imhoff ordered a blockade of the harbor for all non-Dutch ships. Two years later the VOC opened a trade post on Tatas. In 1756 the sultan asked the support of the VOC against the Bugis. In the treaty between Sultan Banjermassin and Johan Andreas Paravinci of October 1756, the VOC got permission to build a stone fort to protect her own and the sultans interest: Fort Tatas.

According to contemporary accounts, Bonthain was an area on Sulawesi's south coast, flanked by the Tino River to the west, the Bonthain mountain to the north and the Kalekongang River to the south. Bonthain traditionally allied itself with Macassar and was ruled by kings. The area was surrounded by rich rice paddies. Thanks to its situation on a big bay, Bonthain was highly suited as a mooring for vessels belonging to neighbouring peoples. VOC records indicate that the populations of Bonthain, Boele and Bera were extremely peaceable in their relations with the Company. The Company appointed a resident to manage the outpost. During the 18th century the outpost grew steadily in size. By 1790 at least 193 VOC employees were stationed in Bonthain and Boelecomba, which lay in a more easterly direction.

Around 1600 Bantam was Java's most important port. It was the first port of call for Dutch vessels in the Indonesian archipelago. The king of Bantam did not enjoy absolute power but was forced to take into account the wishes of his regent and those of the harbour master. Bantam was a wealthy town with an important market that attracted traders from India, Persia and China. However, the town was forced to relinquish its leading position some years later, when Batavia became the VOC's economic centre in Asia. In the early 17th century Bantam was recognised as the principal trading centre of the Indonesian archipelago. Goods of every kind from all over Asia could be found here. For the VOC, spices - particularly pepper - were the most important commodity. The Company tried in vain to establish a key position through its base here; the English opposed them, as did the local regent who feared the VOC would eventually dominate the market. The conflicts increased, and the Company decided to move on to neighbouring Jacatra, which was later to become Batavia. The Dutch first arrived in Bantam in 1596, at a time when the Portuguese had already built up a strong market position some years previously. The Portuguese had no intention of relinquishing their hold on the town to the Dutch newcomers. The Company's relations with the local rulers of the town were strained, as they opposed the VOC's attempts to dominate the market. Throughout the 17th century new conflicts kept plaguing relations between the VOC and Bantam, from which the Company emerged as the victor each time. In 1756 Bantam finally fell under the Company's control.

Batticaloa, the main town on the eastern coast, was one of Joris van Spilbergen's first ports of call in Ceylon, in 1602. When the VOC began driving out the Portuguese in 1638, Batticaloa was once again first to be conquered. The lagoon behind the fort served as a natural harbour. The fort was later rebuilt. The area around Batecalo, now known as Batticaloa, was rich in a wide variety of trading goods: cotton and raw textiles, rice, honey, elephants, timber, wax, areca (a stimulant), and cinnamon. For many years the VOC blockaded the port of Batticaloa for local traders, and only lifted the blockade after peace had been made with the king of Kandy. The fort was used to combat cinnamon smuggling. Although the VOC tried to establish a monopoly in cinnamon, these efforts were not always successful. In 1638, the VOC and the king of Kandy forged an alliance to capture Batticaloa from the Portuguese. The king ordered the torture and execution of those Ceylonese who had sided with the Portuguese. After capturing the fort, the VOC transferred control to the king, who demolished it. Later, when relations with the king deteriorated badly, the Company blockaded the harbour of Batticaloa.

Bequia was under French control in the 18th century and during the Seven Years' War with England, the island was used by the fleets of their Spanish and Dutch allies to take on supplies, while British ships were banned. The Treaty of Paris (1763) produced a significant re-alignment in the map of the Caribbean; St. Vincent and the Grenadine islands, including Grenada, were given to the British in exchange for Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia. The name Petit Martiniquecomes from this era, as does Petit Saint Vincent. In 1779 the French seized the island, despite the Treaty of Paris, but were forced to relinquish control to Britain again soon after. The early 18th century saw the development of a sugar industry and the production of related products including molasses and rum. Other major produce included coffee, indigo and arrowroot. At one point in time, the islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were the single largest producer of arrowroot starch in the world. Currently, Hairoun and Vincy strong rum are major export products primarily to the European Union. Under a programme instituted by Great Britain to give land to indigent settlers James Hamilton, father of Alexander Hamilton, moved from St. Croix to Bequia in 1774 where he remained until 1790. The land granted to Hamilton lies along the shore of Southeast Bay. Despite his son's frequent gifts of money and entreaties to immigrate or at least visit him, neither visited the other

The huge stock market crisis in the Republic ten years later, however, was even more detrimental to the Society and would saddle it with permanent financial problems. Even then, however, the colony continued to grow at a steady pace. - In 1795, like all the remaining West Indian colonies, Berbice fell under the auspices of the Dutch Committee for the Affairs of the Colonies and Possessions on the Guinean Coast and in America, following the establishment of the Batavian Republic and the disbanding of the Society.

After a series of conflicts between the VOC and the population of Buru the Company built a fort by the name of Mandarsjah in 1658. In 1662 it was replaced by the redoubt of Costburg, renamed Oostburg three years later. This redoubt burned down in 1688 as the result of an explosion and subsequently a new wooden fort named Defensie was built there. This fort was built on a square base with four half bastions, two of which with watchtowers. Buru supplied the VOC with carpentry and firewood.

In 1660 vroeg een groep Franse immigranten toestemming aan de Nederlandse directeur-generaal Peter Stuyvesant om een dorp te stichten op het Lange Eiland ofwel long Island. Stuyvesant ging akkoord en wees een plek aan tussen Breukelen en Middleburgh (Maspeth). Het nieuwe dorp met de naam Boswijk groeide snel, in tegenstelling tot een aantal andere nieuwe dorpen op het Lange Eiland. Vanwege oplopende spanningen en conflicten tussen de Engelsen en de Nederlanders, ontmoetten de Boswijkers delegaties van andere dorpen in de wijde omgeving op de 'Gemeene Landts Vergaderinghe' te Nieuw-Amsterdam. De Boswijkers en de andere delegaties verzochten om verduidelijking over de grenzen tussen Engels en Nederlands gebied. De vergadering had geen succes. Een jaar later, in 1664, werd het hele gebied aan de Engelsen overgedragen. Boswijk heette vanaf dat moment Bushwick.

Ten noorden van Frederiksstad ofwel Filipea, de hoofdstad van het gewest Siara (Cearà) lag het plaatsje Cabedelo in de monding van de rivier Paraiba. Hier hadden de Portugezen drie forten gebouwd. Deze drie forten, die samen een strategische driehoek vormden, stelden de ingang tot de nederzetting vanaf de zee veilig. Een klein fort lag op het eiland Restingues in het midden van de monding van de rivier, terwijl de andere twee waren geplaatst op de noordelijke en zuidelijke punten van de monding, tegenover elkaar.Het fort S.

Al in 1631 probeerden de Nederlanders de Portugees-Braziliaanse vestiging gelegen aan Cabo de Santo Agostinho te veroveren, echter zonder succes. Na deze mislukte aanval werd er nieuwe poging gewaagd in 1634. Toen lukte het om enige strategische plaatsen rondom Cabo Agostinho, zoals de kaap ook wel werd genoemd, in handen te krijgen. In dat jaar werd fort Puntal of Pontael veroverd, in brand gestoken en herbouwd met de naam Van der Dussen. Waarschijnlijk in hetzelfde jaar bouwde de WIC bij Cabo de Santo Agostinho het fort Domburg ofwel Gijsselingh. Een jaar later, in 1635, namen de Nederlanders het aan de kaap gelegen Fort Nazarè of Nazareth in, waarmee geheel Cabo São Agostinho in Nederlandse handen kwam. Dit betekende een zware slag voor de Portugezen. Cabo São Agostinho was een belangrijke exportpost voor het vervoer van suiker. In de omgeving waren veel engenhos (suikermolens) en de haven was een gunstige plek waar de schepen konden ankeren. Door de Nederlandse bezetting werd de kaap afgesloten van het achterland, wat zeer nadelig bleek te zijn voor het Portugese verzet dat juist met de suikerwinsten gefinancierd werd.

Here too the Dutch encountered the Zamorin of Calicut - the most powerful Hindu ruler on the Malabar Coast - for the first time. During the time that the VOC enforced its monopoly of the pepper trade Calicut served as a smugglers' haven, with local dealers transporting their pepper via inland waterways.

Between 1641 and 1648, the Dutch had succeeded in taking Luanda (the largest Portuguese slave depot of the African Coast) and the surrounding area from the Portuguese. Subsequently, the Dutch organized expeditions upriver, conquering or founding several settlements along the river Kwanza, including Cambamba. - At the mouth of the Cuanza river, i.e. slightly less than a hundred kilometers west of Cambamba, the Dutch turned an earlier small fortification into a full-fledged fort to defend the river mouth. The fort became known as fort Mols, named after one of the three directors of the area appointed by the West India Company. - The island Ensadeira, where the Dutch met with Dutch resistance, was situated somewhere between the rivermouth and Cambamba; quite probably, it is the island which Blaeu maps of the region call 'Masander'. In his description of Africa, Olfert Dapper mentions the island as being 9 leagues (some 50 kilometers) upriver from the coast, and being some four leagues long and half a league wide, and predominantly producing maniok (cassava).

Under Rijcklof van Goens, the VOC captured the town and fort of Cannanore from the Portuguese in 1663. Because the Portuguese on the Malabar coast had been severely weakened by that time, they offered little resistance to the Company. Cannanore supplied spices such as pepper and cardamom, a spice used in baking cake. In the 18th century look-out posts were set up around Cannanore to combat pepper smuggling by the natives. The Company eventually lost the town and the fort to the English in 1790.

Fort Carolusburg aan de Goudkust, gebouwd door de Zweden in 1653. Het Zweedse fort Carolusburg wordt een paar jaar na de oprichting betrokken door de Denen. Volgens overlevering wordt het hoofd van deze nieuwe Deense post door de Nederlanders wijsgemaakt dat Denemarken is veroverd en dat het behoud van de Deense eigendommen aan de kust een zinloze zaak is. En zo verkoopt de goedgelovige man de Deense posten aan de Nederlanders. Later zullen de Denen het fort wel weer in bezit nemen, maar uiteindelijk gaat de vesting over in Engelse handen: in 1664 veroverden de Engelsen, onder leiding van Captain Robert Holmes, het fort. De vestiging is sindsdien niet heroverd, ondanks een aanval van Michiel de Ruyter in 1665, een Franse aanval in 1757 en diverse aanvallen van plaatselijke stammen.

Since the Cape of Good Hope was the point at which the VOC ships passed one another on their outward and homeward journeys, in 1652 a staging and provisioning post was set up there by Jan van Riebeeck. After some years the town began expanding rapidly since ships sailing under different flags also began using the VOC facilities. Farms sprang up around the settlement to support this expansion. Besides VOC employees and large numbers of Asian and African slaves, the population consisted of free entrepreneurs and craftsmen who carried on a flourishing trade with the numerous seafarers. The refreshment station at Table Bay was never intended as a profit-making venture for the VOC. The Cape could only become self-supporting with the aid of a large population of white farmers. Until the late 17th century the European population was confined to the area between Cape Town and the first mountain ranges of the south-western Cape, an area of roughly 70 by 100 kilometres. But after 1720 they began to spread out across the interior. Between 1720 and the end of the 18th century the colony grew to roughly ten times its former size, while the white population increased from 2,000 to 15,000. Cape Town was established by the VOC as a provisioning and staging post. Its purpose was to supply the Company's ships with fresh produce. There was also a hospital. To minimise costs the VOC kept the settlement as small as possible. Farms around the settlement supplied the VOC with meat, dairy and agricultural produce, including wine, at fixed prices. During the 17th century some of the livestock was acquired through barter with the Hottentots (the Khoi-khoi and San tribes). Later, the white colonists took up livestock farming too. As the European population expanded, they drove the Khoi-khoi and San tribes from their lands. These tribes lived by hunting and cattle farming. From around 1775 the eastern colonists clashed with the Xhosa as both sought to lay claim to fertile summer pastures. The Commander in Cape Town was based at the Castle of Good Hope from where he represented the interests of the entire colonised area of southern Africa as well as the island of Mauritius while a settlement existed there between 1638 and 1710. In the 18th century Cape Town was raised to the status of a governor's province until it was captured by the British in 1795.

De Essequibo rivier ligt in het noorden van Zuid-Amerika, tegenwoordig Brits Guyana. Al vanaf het begin van de 17de eeuw werd dit gebied door de Nederlanders bevaren. In de loop der tijd ving men aan met de verbouw van suikerriet. Ook werd er handel gedreven in orianeverf, maaraan-olie en diverse houtsoorten. Deze producten werden met de indianen uit het binnenland geruild tegen Europese producten. Aan de westelijke oever van de Essequibo, waar de rivieren Cayouni en Mazarouni samenvloeien, lag een plaats genaamd Cartabo. Rond 1770 waren er ongeveer 12 à 15 huizen in het plaatsje. Cartabo lag tegenover het eiland waarop fort Kyk Overal gesitueerd was, de hoofdplaats van de kolonie. Het dorpje was gelegen aan een particuliere plantage met dezelfde naam, in de omgeving van een grote plantage van de West-Indische Compagnie waar cassave werd verbouwd. In 1716 werd besloten om hier een nieuw commandeurshuis te bouwen dat vanaf dat moment bekend stond als 'Huis Nabij', waarschijnlijk omdat dit huis nabij fort Kijk Overal lag. Tussen 1718 en 1739 werd 'Huis Nabij' te Cartabo het nieuwe bestuurscentrum van deze kolonie.

Met de verovering van Brazilië hoopten de Heren XIX, het bestuur van de West-Indische Compagnie, dat er ook andere streken van Zuid-Amerika onder Nederlandse invloed zouden komen. Er werd een expeditie naar Chili georganiseerd zodat de WIC zelf het goud en zilver zou kunnen halen, dat eerder alsmaar in Spaanse handen terechtkwam. De expeditie, onder leiding van Brouwer en Herckmans, vertrok in 1642 vanuit Nederland, via Recife, naar Chili. Het werd nooit een succes. Het lukte de WIC niet om zich er langer dan een paar maanden te vestigen. Het eerste doel van de expeditie was het eiland Chiloe, een strategisch punt van waar uit de Zuid-Amerikaanse kust aangevallen kon worden. Op het eiland bestond een Spaanse nederzetting, Castro en een fort, genaamd Carelmapu. Het fort werd veroverd en het dorp Castro verwoest.

In Cayenne, de hoofdstad van Frans Guyana, stichtten de Fransen in 1624 de eerste Europese volksplanting (kolonie) aan de rivier Sinamari. In 1626 legden zij ook aan de rivier Conanama een volksplanting aan. Ter bescherming van het gebied werd er een fort gebouwd, fort Ceperou, aan de noordoostelijke punt van de monding van de Cayenne rivier. Rondom het fort ontwikkelde zich, tijdens de Franse tijd, een vestiging die zich spoedig tot de stad Cayenne ontwikkelde, de hoofdplaats van de Franse volksplanting. De conflicten tussen de Fransen en de indianen namen in zulke hevige vorm toe dat de Fransen rond 1653 gedwongen waren de stad te verlaten. Uit verschillende bronnen blijkt dat de eerste Nederlanders al rond 1615 de kust van Cayenne hebben aangedaan. Een groep Nederlanders, bestaande uit ongeveer 280 kolonisten, vestigde zich onder leiding van Theodoor Claessen aan de rivier Cayenne. Hun aanwezigheid duurde niet lang: de kolonisten verhuisden naar de nieuwe kolonie Suriname. In 1627 werd er door Claude Prevost, in opdracht van de WIC-kamer Zeeland, een nieuwe poging tot kolonisatie gewaagd, die niet langer dan vijf jaar zou duren. Twee jaar later, in 1634, zouden enkele kolonisten uit de kolonie Essequibo zich wederom in de omgeving van de rivier Cayenne vestigen, om precies te zijn bij het eiland Mecoria, iets ten noorden van de tegenwoordige stad Cayenne; zij vingen aan met de teelt van tabak. Onder leiding van David Pietersz. de Vries werd een nieuwe expeditie georganiseerd. Deze groep verbleef een jaar in een oud Frans fort, dat zij uitbreidden. De belangrijkste Nederlandse expeditie in het gebied Cayenne vond plaats rond 1657. Jan Claessen Langendijck nam, met ongeveer 40 à 50 kolonisten, zijn intrek in het verlaten Franse fort Ceperou (in 1650 door de Fransen gebouwd) aan de noordoostelijke punt van de monding van de rivier Cayenne. De Fransen hadden in 1653 deze vestiging moeten verlaten door conflicten met de plaatselijke bevolking. De kolonie verwelkomde de joden die uit Brazilië waren gevlucht onder leiding van David Nassy in 1658. De Nederlandse kolonie in Cayenne werd in 1659 aan de WIC-Kamer van Amsterdam overgedragen. Pas in 1664 slaagden de Fransen erin om het fort Ceperou (die zij later fort S. Louis zouden noemen) en de nederzetting Cayenne weer in te nemen. In dezelfde periode dat Langendijck in Cayenne neerstreek, was er onder leiding van David Nassy een joodse kolonie opgebloeid in dit gebied. Ook deze kolonie viel, evenals Cayenne, in Franse handen. Met de Vrede van Breda werd besloten dat Cayenne Frans bezit zou blijven. Toch probeerde Jacob Binckes in 1676 Cayenne opnieuw te overvallen en het belangrijke fort Ceperou, nu St. Louis, te veroveren. Na zeven maanden kwamen de Fransen weer terug en heroverden definitief de vestiging en nederzetting.

At the VOC base in Chapra the saltpetre purchased in neighbouring Patna was processed at the Company refinery. The saltpetre was destined for the European market, as it was an essential ingredient in the manufacture of gunpowder. As such the demand for saltpetre mushroomed during wartime. The Company's country estate and gardens at Chapra probably served for the cultivation of vegetables for VOC employees. The reservoir functioned not only as a supply of drinking water, but also provided for the irrigation of the gardens.

De verovering van Brazilië had de Heren XIX doen hopen dat er ook andere streken van Zuid-Amerika onder Nederlandse invloed konden worden onderworpen. De West-Indische Compagnie hoopte met de expeditie naar Chili zelf aan het goud en zilver te kunnen komen dat voorheen alsmaar in Spaanse handen was. De expeditie, onder leiding van Brouwer en Herckmans, vertrok in 1642 vanuit Nederland. Via Recife, de hoofdplaats van Nederlands-Brazilië, werd naar Chili gereisd. De expeditie werd geen succes. Het lukte de WIC niet om zich er langer dan een paar maanden te vestigen. Het eerste doel was het eiland Chiloe, een strategisch punt van waaruit de Zuid-Amerikaanse kust aangevallen kon worden. Op het eiland bestond een Spaanse nederzetting, Castro en een fort, genaamd Carelmapu. Het fort werd veroverd en het dorp Castro verwoest.

The West coast of Sumatra was an important source of pepper . The VOC opened a trading post but the arrival of the Europeans let to growing tensions with the indigenous population. The company decided in 1667 to move her lodge to the small island Cingkuk or Pulau Tjinkoek before the west coast of Sumatra. It was a very strategic location. The sailing route along the coast passed the island, which at its north coast had a good roadstead where the ships could lay at anchor. Traders in pepper and gold visited the island The lodge, which was built on a rocky hill in the middle of the island, was surrounded by a palisade. In 1679 a stone warehouse was built and a stone wall of five meter high and 0,75 m thick. People could enter the enclosure by two gates: one in the north wall and the other at the south side. Francois Valentijn mentioned that the island devoured people because of the great heat, the insalubrious humidity and the poisonous vapors. Pulau Cingkuk should have become the main office of the VOC on the west coast of Sumatra, but in 1670 the company choose for Padang, which was much healthier than the island. During the Fourth Anglo Dutch War (1780-1784) all the offices of on the West coast of Sumatra surrendered after the arrival of ships of the Est India Company. They were returned to the VOC after the peace in Europe was signed. The same thing happened during the wars between Great Britain and France and its allies (1795-1816) In 1818 the Dutch returned to Pulau Cingkuk and rebuilt the trade buildings, but the island lost most of its importance to Padang. The remains of the buildings are now turned into a historical tourist spot. Strange enough the explanation signs on the island mention wrongly that the ruins are the remains of a Portuguese fort.

Tjutjura, now known as Chunchura functioned as the headquarters of the VOC in Bengal. Originally situated in the neighbouring town of Houghly, the base was relocated in 1656. The two names were subsequently used indiscriminately. This base was said to be the most beautiful in Asia. The town was notorious for its corrupt VOC officials whose only aim was to get rich as quickly as possible by trading for their own account - much to the displeasure of the VOC's central administration in Batavia. The fort was known for its size and strength. It bore the name of 'Gustavus' after Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff, who held the post of governor-general from 1743 to 1750. Situated close to the fort was a shipyard and a burial ground. In the 18th century the director ordered a church and a school to be built for the local population. This meant that many of the Company's employees were more involved with their own private trade - to the concern of the VOC's central administration at Batavia. The VOC complex at Houghly and Chinsura expanded rapidly in the late 17th century. There were warehouses for cotton, opium, ginger and hemp. The popular Bengal silk was also stored in Chinsura from where it was shipped to Batavia and Japan. Another Bengali product was sugar, which was sold in Persia at a great profit. In Chinsura the Company operated an unusual agreement with the nawab, the local representative of the Mogul emperor. In effect, the Company rented the city. The local administration was not in the hands of the governor, but of the fiscal, who functioned as a kind of mayor. His task was to protect the Company's property and to administer justice over the local population. The VOC's Bengali bases fell under the jurisdiction of the Coromandel governor until 1655, after which Bengal became an independent directorate with its headquarters in Chinsura.

Portugal's base in Cochin dated from as early as 1503. There the Portuguese built Fort Manuel, the first European fort in India. Around a century and a half later, Cochin was captured by the VOC under the command of Rijcklof van Goens. Cochin subsequently expanded to become the Company's main base on the Malabar coast. The rajah of Cochin granted the Company a monopoly in pepper and cinnamon.A commander was based in Cochin to administer the whole of the Malabar coast on behalf of the VOC. However, the town was too large to enable it to be defended against enemies so it was reduced in size to within the surrounding walls. Many of the original Portuguese buildings were demolished or converted into warehouses. The VOC also built a hospital in Cochin, together with an orphanage and terraced housing for its workers and soldiers.In 1676 the Company acquired the pepper monopoly on the Malabar coast. But even this failed to give it control of all pepper production. However, this did not give it control of all pepper production. Because English merchants paid higher prices for their pepper, local traders preferred to sell to them rather than to the VOC. Corruption within the VOC ranks, as well as pepper smuggling to places outside the VOC's monopoly, caused profits to dwindle away completely in the 18th century.In 1663 Rijcklof van Goens dealt a telling blow to the Portuguese. One of the descendants of the old rajah applied to the VOC for aid against the Portuguese and his overlord, the ruler of Cochin. At first the Company only took Cochin because of its strategic importance - the Portuguese presence in the Malabar region was seen as a threat to the nearby island of Ceylon, which the VOC had recently acquired. From 1661 the Malabar coast was captured from the Portuguese piece by piece. Malabar remained under the jurisdiction of the governor of Ceylon until in 1663 it became an independent section under a commander based in Cochin.In 1795 Cochin fell to the English.

Colombo, capital of Ceylon, was a busy trading and administrative centre during the VOC era. From Colombo the VOC pursued a policy aimed at spreading the Protestant faith among the Ceylonese population. The availability of a printer's in Colombo that published the Christian scriptures in the local language made it easier to bridge the gap with the local population. Nowhere else in Asia was the VOC's involvement in the administration of a region as long lasting and intensive as it was in Ceylon. The Company was a sovereign power on the island. Colombo was severely damaged during its conquest by the Company in 1656 and had to be rebuilt. The new town was divided into a fort and an urban section. The urban part of Colombo became a busy multicultural trading centre, where many Dutch settled permanently as free citizens after retiring from the VOC. Colombo was the central storage depot for cinnamon, Ceylon's most important product. The VOC established an extensive organisation to harvest and transport cinnamon, within which specific tasks were allotted to the various castes in Ceylonese society. The Company also introduced pepper and coffee cultivation to Ceylon. However the cultivation of coffee ended in failure due to poor organisation. The VOC administration in Ceylon was engaged in a continuous war of attrition with the kingdom of Kandy. This friction came to a head on two occasions: first under Governor Rijcklof van Goens, who aimed to make Ceylon the VOC's central power base in Asia - against the wishes of the king, and indeed against those of Batavia. The second was in 1760, when war broke out between Kandy and the Company. The VOC won this war. Every year delegations from both side visited one another. Colombo was the capital of Ceylon, a Company government which also covered part of the southern tip of India until 1663. Ceylon was further divided into two departments or 'commandements', Galle and Jaffna. Each was headed by its own commander, subject to the governor in Colombo. In 1795 Ceylon was captured by the English.

Tengapatnam, also known as Cuddalore, was situated on the souther Coromandel Coast, about 70 miles north of Nagapatnam. The town should not be confused with the place of the same name on the south Indian coast near Trivandrum. In 1608 the Dutch were granted permission to use an old fort as a place of trade. Because of the fort's impractibility the town was abandoned in favour of Thiruppapuliyur further south. Later the VOC was to build a lodge in Tengapatnam where the chief resided along with other VOC employees. The lodge was situated in the centre of the village, surrounded by a wall with four bastions. Tengapatnam was a key location for the purchase of 'lijnwaten' but also functioned as a leisure destination for the merchants. In 1647 the Company was granted permission to build a fort there manned by 60 people.

In 1652 the VOC settlement on the island of Dammer was attacked by people from the neighbouring island. Nine Company employees, including a native of Maccassar, were murdered. A year earlier the VOC had forced the Damme population to destroy more than 14,000 nutmeg trees on the nearby island of Nila, in a move aimed at preventing competing traders from buying the nutmeg and driving up the price. The attack led the Dutch to establish a post elsewhere, on the nearby island of Babar. Later the outpost on Dammer, known as Wilhelmus, was restored.

Dodingo, now known as Dodinga, lay to the right of the island of Ternate on the Halmahera coast. According to Pieter van Dam, who recorded the history of the VOC in 1701, Dodingo was badly suited to agriculture. Here a neighbouring tribe known as the Alfoer had once built a small fort in a bid to prevent skirmishes between the Company and the Tidorese. Later, in 1713, under Governor David van Peterson, Dodinga was occupied by the VOC in a move to prevent disputes over Ternate and Tidore. The occupation meant the Company was able effectively to protect the bay of Dodinga, in which the islands of Ternate and Tidore lay.

Drakenstein, the name of which derives from the visit paid to the region by Baron van Rheede tot Drakenstein in 1685, was founded in that same year. Between 1685 and 1690 many French Huguenots settled here. For this reason most of the farms in the district carry French names such as La Motte, Bien Donné and Rhone. It was a prosperous district where agriculture was the most important activity. The area's principal products were grain, fruit and wine.

Al in 1482 vestigden de Portugezen zich in São Jorge da Mina, ofwel Elmina aan de Goudkust. Tien jaar daarvoor waren immers de rijke goudlanden ontdekt. De naam Elmina betekent letterlijk: 'de mijn'. De Portugese handel werd zo omvangrijk, dat de plaatselijke handelaren hulp nodig hadden bij het transport van de goederen naar het binnenland, zoals bij het transport van lakens, linnen en koper. Om aan deze vraag te voldoen zetten de Portugezen in het begin van de 16de eeuw een handelsnetwerk van slaven op. Toen de goudmarkt instortte doordat het goud uit Mexico goedkoper werd, verslapte de Portugese macht aan de Goudkust zodanig dat Nederlandse aanvallen niet langer meer afgeweerd konden worden. Vanaf 1637 wordt Elmina het hoofdkwartier van de Nederlanders aan de Goudkust. Dat blijft zo tot 1872-1873 als de Nederlanders het gebied verlaten. Tijdens de Nederlandse aanwezigheid groeide Elmina uit tot 15.000 in de 18de eeuw. Vooral de handel in goud en slaven was voor de WIC van grote betekenis. De omvang van het fort Elmina geeft duidelijk aan hoe belangrijk deze handelspost -dé doorvoerhaven van slaven naar de nieuwe wereld- aan de Goudkust was. Volgens Barbot, die het fort in 1682 bezocht, kende dit fort geen gelijkwaardige variant aan de Goudkust.Het WIC-bestuur in Elmina bemerkte dat een goede verstandshouding met de Ashanti de handel vergemakkelijkte. De Ashanti bestonden uit diverse stammen uit het achterland van de Goudkust. Zij hadden zich op het einde van de 17de eeuw verenigd. Tot aan het einde van de Nederlandse aanwezigheid op de Goudkust in 1872, was het proberen de banden met de Ashanti in stand te houden een belangrijk doel van de Nederlanders.Na de verovering van Elmina op de Portugezen bouwden de Nederlanders een tweede fort, genaamd Coenraadsburg ofwel St. Jago. Deze vestiging werd neergezet op de heuvel tegenover fort Elmina, waar eerder een kerkje van de Portugezen stond. De Portugese kerk werd omgebouwd tot een veilinghal.

Particularly in northern Ceylon many of the local population had been converted to Catholicism by the Portugeuse. As the principal European power in the region after 1658 the VOC saw it as imperative that Protestantism be promoted in its place to gain the loyalty of its new subjects. To this end it opened schools for the provision of religious education. The school at Eluthumadduval numbered around 650 pupils. Here the Company also had stables for elephants which were sold to supply the armies of the Indian princes.

According to Postma, the WIC had a trading post in Epe or Appa. According to Den Heijer, this place was named Appa by the Dutchman Hendrik Hartog. Hartog had worked in another place with the same name, but further west (Epe or Appa 1 in this database), but had to flee from there in 1738 due to wars between the local rulers. Appa 1 and the WIC fort there was destroyed by the enemies of the king of Dahomey, whose side Hartog had chosen in the conflict. Hartog then moved operations to Appa 2, some 120 kilometres east of Pattackerie.

The inhabitants of Erang and the surrounding villages had a reputation of selling their cloves to traders from Makassar and Java, which was in violation with the treaties with the VOC. For this reason, VOC troops attacked Erang in 1633, destroying the settlement and the surrounding clove plantations. In 1652, during the Great Ambon War (1651-1656), the settlement was attacked and destroyed again. At the end of the war, the entire peninsula was depopulated, and the people living there forced to relocate.

Ispahan, now known as Esfahan, was the capital of the kingdom of Persia. Ispahan lay on the caravan route between Central Asia and the Persian Gulf. The VOC's trade in Persia depended on its political relations with the shah, who held court here. The VOC bought silk from the shah in exchange for spices and military protection. The VOC were based here from 1623 to 1746, although after 1741 manufacturing activities were very low key. In trade Isfahan barely had a role to play after 1670. The trading station served principally as a means of maintaining relations with the royal court. The VOC was obliged to maintain its office in Ispahan due to the endless negotiations with the shah about trading concessions. The shah gave the VOC the use of this splendid house with adjoining gardens for as long as the Company continued to trade in Persia. In 1722 Ispahan was conquered by the Afghans. Trading came to a halt and in 1747 the VOC base was closed. The head office of the VOC's Persian directorate was located in Esfahan from 1623 to 1638.

The Lisbon merchant Fernão de Loronha held not only Fernando de Noronha island as a hereditary captaincy but also (from 1503 to around 1512) a commercial monopoly on trade in Brazil. Between 1503 and 1512, Noronha's agents set up a string of warehouses (feitorias) along the Brazilian coast, and engaged in trade with the indigenous peoples in Brazil for brazilwood, a native red dye wood highly valued by European clothmakers. Fernando de Noronha island was the central collection point of this network. Brazilwood, continuously harvested by the coastal Indians and delivered to the various coastal warehouses, was shipped to the central warehouse on Fernando de Noronha island, which was intermittently visited by a larger transport ship that would carry the collected loads back to Europe. After the expiration of Loronha's commercial charter in 1512, the organization of the brazilwood enterprise was taken over by the Portuguese crown, but Loronha and his descendents retained private ownership of Fernando de Noronha island itself as a hereditary captaincy, at least down to the 1560s.

Ten oosten van de Braziliaanse kust, ongeveer op de hoogte van de stad Fortaleza, ligt de archipel Fernando de Noronha. Deze kleine eilanden werden door de WIC in 1630 in bezit genomen. In datzelfde jaar bouwden de Nederlanders een fort in het noorden van het grootste eiland. Waarschijnlijk stond het fort op een heuvel aan de baai van Santo Antonio, de belangrijkste ankerplaats van deze eilanden waar later de Portugezen dit fort hebben herbouwd. Het fort, bekend met de Portugese naam Forte de (Nossa Senhora de) Remedios, was in 1654, het jaar van de Nederlandse capitulatie, de laatste versterking die door de Nederlanders in Brazilië werd verlaten. Het gebouw diende ook als hospitaal voor gewonde soldaten, een functie die ook later door de Portugezen werd behouden. De eilanden Fernando de Noronha bleken al snel van weinig belang te zijn omdat ze weinig opleverden. Bovendien werden de eilanden geteisterd door ratten die het verbouwen van allerlei gewassen onmogelijk maakten. De WIC plaatste Gillis Venant (met een paar slaven en 23.000 gulden) op het eiland en gaf hem de opdracht mee het gewas indigo, dat uit het oosten kwam, te gaan verbouwen. Dit bleek geen succes. Er wordt in een document van de WIC (in een brief van 26 maart 1634 van Willem Joostensz. Glimmer. Nr. 50 folio 56, zie 'Oude WIC-archief' in het Nationaal Archief, Den Haag) gesproken over fort Ceeburgh dat zou liggen op een van de eilanden Fernando de Noronha.

Zij oefenden hun geloof publiekelijk uit. Dit was in strijd met wat het WIC-bestuur in Nieuw-Nederland als 'staatsreligie' had afgekondigd: het Gereformeerde geloof. Deze afkondiging was op haar beurt in tegenspraak met de reglementen van de Unie van Utrecht, namelijk dat iedere burger zijn eigen geloof mag uitoefenen.

In 1637 the Portuguese-owned region of Cearà or Siara, situated to the north of Pernambuco, was conquered by the Dutch West-India Company (WIC) without much resistance. Indigenous tribes had requested Dutch help in their fight against the Portuguese in the region, who grew sugar cane there. For the WIC, the area proved to be more attractive for winning salt than for growing sugar cane. When the Dutch conquered the region in 1637, the Portuguese fort Siara had been there for quite a few years. The Dutch abandoned Siara by the end of 1643. An epidemic of smallpox and the forced labour led the indigenous population to revolt against the Dutch. The Dutch population in Siara was entirely wiped out. In April 1649, Siara was retaken by the WIC. A new fort was erected, named Fort Schoonenburgh. The WIC's main interest there was in the silver mines in the vicinity. Siara was subsequently ceded to Portugal as part of the Dutch surrender of their Brazilian territories in 1654.

Franschhoek became home to around 200 French Huguenots who had initially fled to the Netherlands after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. Via the VOC they landed at the Cape, where the Dutch wished to found a colony. The French gained free passage to the Cape, provided they first swore allegiance to the Company. In the Huguenot district, as the area around Franschhoek was known, the French built farms and established vineyards.

De Engelsman Thomas Pell stichtte in 1654 het dorp Westchester, nu in het meest zuidelijke deel van The Bronx. De Engelsen bezetten steeds meer land dat de Nederlanders eerder van de Indianen hadden gekocht. Rond 1656 vormde dit steeds meer een probleem voor Peter Stuyvesant, de toenmalige gouverneur van Nieuw-Nederland. Om die reden nam Stuyvesant Westchester in en herdoopte de plaats in Vreedland, land van Vrede. Later werd het dorp Oostdorp genoemd aangezien het ten oosten lag van het Nederlandse handelscentrum Nieuw-Amsterdam.

After the VOC was driven out of Taiwan in 1662, it tried to gain access to the porcelain and silk trade at the port of Fuzhou, which was then also known as Hocksiew. However, the Company's attempts to trade there were hampered by a string of bureaucratic restrictions. As early as 1655 a Dutch delegation had visited the Imperial court in Peking (Beijing), but had had little opportunity to discuss trading conditions. A visit of this kind was regarded solely as a token of the respect to which the emperor was entitled. In 1666 a second delegation was sent to Peking Beijing. It was led by the ambassador Pieter van Hoorn. But aside from some dazzling descriptions of China, this journey also yielded nothing. Although the trading post at Fuzhou barely made a profit, the VOC kept it on until 1681.

From 1640 onwards, the VOC maintained a presence in Galle, the main port in southern Ceylon. Ships needed a pilot to reach the harbour here because the entrance to the bay was full of treacherous rocks. The VOC extended and strengthened the fort at Galle, which the Portuguese had abandoned. Every year on December 25 the great homeward-bound fleet set sail from Galle laden with merchandise for the Dutch Republic. These ships met the VOC fleet from Batavia at the Cape of Good Hope from whence they embarked on the Atlantic crossing together. Galle was one of the big transhipment ports where Asian products were collected and shipped out to the Dutch Republic. In 1771 the cargo of one ship bound for Holland comprised pepper, coffee, cardamom, sappan wood, myrrh, catechu (a remedy), and cinnamon from Ceylon. It also carried pepper, coffee, textiles, cowrie shells, saltpetre and figs from other regions. The cowrie shells were used as currency in the slave trade in Africa. Rice was imported into Galle. The Company forged an alliance with the king of Kandy to drive the Portuguese out of Ceylon. But once the Portuguese hold was broken the Company and the king became adversaries. As the Sinhalese monarch, the king continued to have great influence over the VOC's new subjects. Relations improved after 1687 when the new king of Kandy recognised the Company's sovereignty over Ceylon in addition to its trading interests. From 1640 onwards Galle functioned as the VOC's administrative centre on Ceylon, until Colombo was captured from the Portuguese in 1656. Galle subsequently became one of the two departments, or 'commandements', into which the government of Ceylon was divided, falling under the jurisdiction of the governor in Colombo.

In 1501, Gibraltar passed back to the Spanish Crown, and Isabella I of Castile issued a Royal Warrant granting Gibraltar the coat of arms that it still uses today. In 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession, a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet, representing the Grand Alliance, captured the town of Gibraltar on behalf of the Archduke Charles of Austria in his campaign to become King of Spain. The occupation of the town by Alliance forces caused the exodus of the population to the surrounding area of the Campo de Gibraltar. As the Alliance's campaign faltered, the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht was negotiated and ceded control of Gibraltar to Britain to secure Britain's withdrawal from the war. Unsuccessful attempts by Spanish monarchs to regain Gibraltar were made with the siege of 1727 and again with the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779 to 1783), during the American War of Independence.

Het eerste Nederlandse postje aan de Delaware Rivier, gesticht in 1624, was gelegen op Hoog Eiland, nu Burlington Island. Deze rivier werd door de Nederlanders de Zuid Rivier genoemd, aangezien de rivier de 'hoofdweg' van het zuidelijke gebied van Nieuw-Nederland vormde. Daartegenover stond de Hudson Rivier die de Noord Rivier werd genoemd. Toen na de bouw van fort Amsterdam in 1625 de plaats Nieuw-Amsterdam op Manhattan als hoofdplaats ging dienen van Nieuw-Nederland, werd de post op Hoog Eiland verlaten en vervangen door het zuidelijker gelegen fort Nassau. Dit fort Nassau zou ook in 1626 gebouwd zijn. Hier kochten de Nederlanders bont van de Lenni Lenape indianen uit de regio. Rond 1651 besloot Peter Stuyvesant, directeur-generaal van Nieuw-Nederland, fort Nassau te verlaten.

The land muster-rolls of the year 1740 mention the city of Goa, where 17 VOC employees were stationed. The reference probably pertains to the residence of the king of Goa, who in the mid-17th century ruled over the sultanate of Macassar, under whose aegis the city of Macassar fell. According to Stavorinus, a contemporary writer, the king of Goa was a peaceful ruler, allowing Malays to settle in the region and practice their religion. This tolerance of other peoples resulted in competition, which hampered the Company's trade relations. For this reason the VOC exploited the disputes that arose between Goa and the neighbouring king of Bone, which fell under the sultanate of Goa. The Company engineered an accord with Bone its battle for the city of Macassar, which was taken by Speelman in 1667.

According to some historians, the English merchant Anthony de la Roché was the first to land on the island, in the austral autumn of 1675. Charles Gough rediscovered the island on 3 March 1732, thinking it was Gonçalo Álvares, although he found it to be 400 miles further to the east of where it was mapped. This turned out to be correct, and since then, the name 'Gough's Island' became prevalent. In the intervening years, the island was also sighted by several VOC vessels, including the Oranje in 1656.

In 1678 the Sultan of Ternate relinquished his claims over Gorontalo to the VOC. In 1681 the governor of the Moluccas, Robertus Padtbrugge, brought Gorontalo under the direct control of the Company, The Company didn't want to be involved in the unstable territory too much, and the main reason the remained in the area was to keep it free of spice trees and European rivals, to control the busy indigenous shipping and to offer protection against pirates. Their merchants bought rice and sold Indian textiles. The interest of the company dramatically increased after the discovery of gold in the mountains of Gorontalo in 1720. During the 1770s, however, it became clear to the VOC that its policy of sea patrols, small forts and diplomacy weren't enough to control the gold trade. The local rulers used the protection of the VOC to enrich themselves by selling the gold to Indonesian traders.

Lady Deborah Moody was de eerste vrouw die een vestiging stichtte in Nieuw-Nederland. Zij hing het anababtistische geloof aan, dat in Engeland zoveel problemen veroorzaakte dat zij hoopte in 'de nieuwe wereld' beter zou kunnen slagen. Ze vertrok naar Massachusetts Bay in 1639, maar zag dat de godsdienstvrijheden daar net zo gering waren als in haar moederland. Een uitnodiging van de Nederlandse gouverneur Willem Kieft om een kleine kolonie te stichten op het Lange Eiland, ofwel Long Island, kwam dan ook goed uit. De inwoners zouden vrij zijn hun eigen geloof te belijden. Het dorp viel onder Nederlands bestuur.

In 1649 a French expedition of 203 men from Martinique led by Jacques du Parquet founded a permanent settlement on Grenada. Within months this led to conflict with the local islanders which lasted until 1654 when the island was completely subjugated by the French.[11] The indigenous islanders who survived either left for neighbouring islands or retreated to remoter parts of Grenada where they were marginalised—the last distinct communities disappeared during the 1700s. Warfare continued during the 1600s between the French on Grenada and the Caribs of present-day Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The French named their new colony La Grenade, and the economy was initially based on sugar cane and indigo. The French established a capital known as Fort Royal (later St. George). To shelter from hurricanes the French navy would often take refuge in the capital's natural harbour, as no nearby French islands had a natural harbour to compare with that of Fort Royal. The British captured Grenada during the Seven Years' War in 1762.

Grissee was an important port and storage depot for food, pepper and textiles. The Dutch had difficulty in establishing a firm foothold here because they did not have the particular textiles the Javanese wanted; nor could they compete with the low prices of the Portuguese. The trading post was closed down when the Company found that it could not prevent its competitors from exporting.

The outpost at Groene Cloof was established in a bid to repel attacks by the Hottentot peoples. The region, which had originally been inhabited by the Cochoqua tribe of herdsmen, was extremely rich in natural vegetation and was known for its broad valley. Over the 10 years from 1673 to 1683 the VOC succeeded in driving the Cochoqua from the region through a combination of war, annexation and taxes. Groene Cloof was used to step up livestock numbers and to help provide food supplies for the Cape of Good Hope. The post comprised a walled complex with a post house, a warehouse, a shop and livery stables. It was surrounded by extensive gardens with a fountain. When the post was abandoned in 1790, it was inhabited by nine European colonists and 21 slaves.

Groningen was een van de posten van het Cordonpad, dat tussen 1776 en 1778 werd opgericht. Het was in wezen een stelsel van militairen posten die van het beginpunt aan de Suriname rivier (post Gelderland bij de Joodse Savanne) naar de rivier Commewijne en vandaar langs de Cottica kreek tot aan de zee liep. Dit postenstelsel werd geïnitieerd met als doel het weglopen van vele slaven uit de plantages te voorkomen, maar ook om de plantages te beschermen tegen aanvallen van gevluchte slaven, die onder leiding van Boni in opstand waren gekomen. Boni was een weggelopen slaaf die in de 18de eeuw een opstand organiseerde in Suriname, bekend als de Boni oorlogen. Deze vonden plaats tussen 1765 en 1793 en vormden een groot probleem voor het WIC-bestuur in het welvarende Suriname. De post Groningen lag aan de Saramacca rivier en werd in 1790 opgericht tijdens het bewind van Jan Gerhard Wickers.

At Groote Schuur, 15 kilometres east of the Fort of Good Hope, Van Riebeeck built a grain store. The place was also known as 'de Schuur'. Groote Schuur was also used as a place of worship around 1663. In 1666 the place offered work to 25 colonists and a large number of slaves, both male and female. The grain store had originally been built with the aim of providing grain for the settlement in Cape Town and the VOC ships that put in there on their way to the east. Later it became a trading post for wood, among other things. The trading post was closed down in 1788.

The kings of Goeli-Goeli and Geser joined forces to fight against the Company. Goeli-Goeli served as a focus for people who had fled the iron rule of the Company. Although at first the population appeared to be implacable, in 1661 these villages nevertheless signed a peace agreement with the VOC. The Company had earlier been granted permission to build a fort at this end of Seram; the fort was named 'Oosteinde', or 'East End'.

The small island of Gunung Api is situated near the larger island of Neira. Gunung Api means 'Fire mountain' or volcano. After this volcano erupted in 1691, the supply of nutmeg and mace on Gunung Api, as well as on the neighbouring islands of Neira and Lonthor, declined drastically. This resulted in a substantial rise in the price of these spices, which were exclusive to Banda.

The Hambantota station was situated in southern Ceylon, east of Tangale. It was the final VOC station in the south of the island. In the 19th century the British erected a tower on the remains of a Dutch fort from 1765. Hambantota operated chiefly as an entrepot, and was of strategic importance in guarding the salt pans and access to the cinnamon plantations.

In the 17th century the northern part of what is now Vietnam belonged to the kingdom of Tonkin. The country was a major silk producer. The silk which the VOC bought there was particularly valuable for trade with Japan. Towards the end of the 1630s, the Company signed an agreement with the king of Tonkin and opened a trading post in or near today's Hanoi. The VOC maintained a trading post in Tonkin from 1636 to 1699. This trading post was run by an 'opperhoofd' or supervisor.

Haarlem was de oude naam van de huidige wijk Harlem op het New Yorkse eiland Manhattan. Het was de tweede vestiging van de WIC op Manhattan. In 1658 besloot het WIC-bestuur te Nieuw-Amsterdam, op de zuidpunt van Manhattan, dat er een tweede plaats gesticht moest worden op de noordpunt van het eiland: Haarlem. Deze nieuwe plaats zou de Nederlanders moeten helpen het eiland te verdedigen tegen invallen aan de noordzijde door Engelsen en Indianen.

In 1633 besloot Wouter van Twiller, gouverneur van Nieuw-Nederland, om Jacob van Curler op expeditie te sturen naar de Verse Rivier, tegenwoordig de Connecticut River. De Nederlanders handelden daarvoor al met de Indianen van dit gebied, maar omdat de Engelsen zich mengden in de handel besloot Van Twiller haast te maken met het stichten van een post. Hij was geïnstrueerd om direct een handelspost op te richten met de naam Huis ter Hope. Daarnaast moest hij het versterken met twee kanonnen. Ondanks de bouw van deze post vestigden de Engelsen zich in de buurt. Huis ter Hope bleef slechts een buitenpost waardoor de Nederlanders hun zeggenschap in het gebied kwijtraakten.

In 1600, two years before the VOC was founded, the Dutch built the fort of Verre here in order to oppose the Portuguese who controlled trade in the area. The fort, named after the Compagnie van Verre, was built with the aid of the local population. They called the fort Kota Warwijck, after the first Dutch seafarer to have set foot on Ambon. The fort was soon abandoned.

Officially, the population of this region was indirectly ruled by the Sultan of Ternate and therefore allied to the VOC. In practice, the relationship between its inhabitants and the VOC was complicated and fractious, as this clove-producing region did not like the VOC's attempts to controle the clove trade. The entire region was ultimately depopulated in the Great Ambon War (1651-1656) and the village ceased to exist. - The indicated location is approximate.

In 1609 the VOC was granted a trading permit from the Shogun of Japan giving the Company access to Japanese ports and waters. The VOC was also permitted to set up a base on the small Japanese island of Hirado, known as Firando by Europeans at that time. Each year the head of the trading post there was required to pay his respects to the Shogun in Edo, today's Tokyo. Because the Shoguns were keenly interested in Dutch cannon, an iron foundry was built on Firando. From 1609 to 1641 Firando served as an important port and storage depot for trade in Chinese territorial waters. The main trading product was Chinese silk, which was exchanged for precious metals in Japan. At the end of the 1630s free trade in Japan came to an end. In 1641 the VOC was required to move its base to the small island of Deshima in the bay of Nagasaki, where it was subject to stringent rules and surveillance imposed by the Japanese government.

In the 17th century, pirates and privateers of various nationalities had bases on the island. In 1665, French colonization of the island was officially recognized by King Louis XIV and the the French colony was given the name Saint-Domingue. In the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, Spain formally ceded the western third of the island to France. Saint-Domingue quickly came to overshadow the east in both wealth and population. Nicknamed the 'Pearl of the Antilles,' it became the richest and most prosperous colony in the West Indies. - During the French Revolution, Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, later to become the Dominican Republic. The French side, meanwhile, revolted against Spanish rule and became the independent state of Haiti.

The king of Hitoe, the northern part of the island of Ambon, held court at Hiettolama. The Company did no business with this king, but dealt instead with Captain Hitoe, who wielded the real power. At first Captain Hitoe was an implacable enemy of the Company, but later negotiation became possible; the VOC could have the clove monopoly provided they did not attempt to convert the population to Christianity. Contrary to the agreement, Captain Hitoe traded with the Ternate islanders, who were Muslims like himself. Religious differences played an important role in trade on Ambon and the Company was continuously plagued by difficulties in compelling the rebellious Muslim villages to sell their cloves exclusively to the VOC.

Tjutjura, now known as Chunchura functioned as the headquarters of the VOC in Bengal. Originally situated in the neighbouring town of Houghly, the base was relocated in 1656. The two names were subsequently used indiscriminately. This base was said to be the most beautiful in Asia. The town was notorious for its corrupt VOC officials whose only aim was to get rich as quickly as possible by trading for their own account - much to the displeasure of the VOC's central administration in Batavia. The fort was known for its size and strength. It bore the name of 'Gustavus' after Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff, who held the post of governor-general from 1743 to 1750. Situated close to the fort was a shipyard and a burial ground. In the 18th century the director ordered a church and a school to be built for the local population. This meant that many of the Company's employees were more involved with their own private trade - to the concern of the VOC's central administration at Batavia. The VOC complex at Houghly and Chinsura expanded rapidly in the late 17th century. There were warehouses for cotton, opium, ginger and hemp. The popular Bengal silk was also stored in Chinsura from where it was shipped to Batavia and Japan. Another Bengali product was sugar, which was sold in Persia at a great profit. In Chinsura the Company operated an unusual agreement with the nawab, the local representative of the Mogul emperor. In effect, the Company rented the city. The local administration was not in the hands of the governor, but of the fiscal, who functioned as a kind of mayor. His task was to protect the Company's property and to administer justice over the local population. The VOC's Bengali bases fell under the jurisdiction of the Coromandel governor until 1655, after which Bengal became an independent directorate with its headquarters in Chinsura.

Ten noorden van de stad Recife, de hoofdstad van Nederlands-Brazilië, ligt het eiland Itamaracà. Tijdens de 17de eeuw was het eiland Itamaracà een zelfstandig gewest in bestuurlijk opzicht. Rond 1633 was het geheel door de WIC bezet. Het eiland, een zeer belangrijke bron van voedsel en verversingen voor de latere hoofdstad van de WIC Recife, bleek heel vruchtbaar te zijn: verschillende soorten fruit groeiden in overvloed, er was vers water en een gedeelte van het eiland was ook geschikt voor het verbouwen van voedsel. In 1630 lukte de Nederlanders het Portugese fort de Santa Cruz te veroveren dat langs de kust van het eiland lag. De Portugezen trokken zich terug in de heuvels in een plaats genaamd Nossa Senhora da Conceicao. Na de verovering werd het fortje aan het strand door de Nederlanders herdoopt in fort Oranje ofwel Orange. Het was aanvankelijk een zeer bescheiden vestiging met enkel een palissade, maar het was gelegen op een strategisch punt en waardoor het een degelijke bescherming gaf aan de ingang van het eiland. In 1633, toen kolonel van Schoppe en zijn soldaten vanuit fort Oranje de Portugezen van het eiland verdreven, werd de voormalig Portugese plaats in de heuvels Nossa Senhora da Conceicao door de Nederlandser versterkt. Zodoende ontstond daar in 1633 de nederzetting Van Schoppestad. Aan de noordelijke kant van het eiland was er nog een bastion ter verdediging. Fort Oranje, dat begin 21ste eeuw gerestaureerd is, werd door de jaren heen verbouwd tot een stevige vierhoekige vestiging. Binnen het fort was er ruimte voor een wapenkamer en waren er barakken voor de soldaten.

Jaffna was a busy trading city and the main centre in northern Ceylon. The last bastion of the Portuguese on the island, it fell to the Company in 1658. For the time being the VOC had eliminated all its European competitors on the island. The Company rebuilt much of Jaffna. The Portuguese fort made way for a new one designed according to the latest military principles. The result was an almost impregnable citadel, perhaps the strongest VOC fort in Asia. Construction work, which began in 1660, was finally completed some 130 years later, in 1792. The fort was an important link, guarding the sea lanes to and from India. In Jaffna fort the VOC built a church, known as 'Kruys' (Cross) church. With its layout in the form of a Greek cross, it was typical of Calvinist architecture. Women attending the church services would have their slaves bring chairs which would be taken away again afterwards. The church was built in 1706 and could accommodate 600 people. In the Jaffna region, too, Protestantism was preached with enthusiasm, but the native population often had little idea of the difference between Protestantism and Catholicism. In the busy trading town of Jaffna the merchants maintained close contacts with the mainland. The main products of the town and region were cotton, clothes, pearls and elephants. The elephants were sold for the armies of Indian princes. The animals were captured by driving them into a fenced enclosure from where they were taken one by one to be bound and even sometimes to be baptised. After eight days of being tied up an elephant would be more or less tame and ready to be trained. In northern Ceylon the Company enjoyed a certain measure of territorial authority; a unique position for an organisation primarily concerned with trade which (except on Formosa) generally left local rulers in control. On Ceylon this authority involved the Company was responsible for collecting taxes from the local population, among other things. Because the Company levied far higher taxes than was customary, the local inhabitants rose up against the VOC in 1676. However the Company crushed the rebellion and implemented the levy anyway. Jaffna was also the capital of one of the 'commandementen', or departments, into which Ceylon was divided and fell under the jurisdiction of the governor in Colombo.

Bantam was the Company's first base in Asia. After relations with the local rulers worsened, the Company relocated to neighbouring Jacatra, a vassal state of Bantam. The ensuing war was won by the VOC. In 1619, Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen built the new city of Batavia on the ruins of Jacatra. This coastal town became the seat of the East Indies Council, the Company's administrative centre in Asia. The castle at Batavia was the first building visible from the sea. The governor-general and his councillors lived in this coastal fortress together with workers and a garrison of 1200 men. Batavia was the vibrant centre of the VOC's business in Asia; here the Company kept the accounts for all its trading bases and the East Indies Council held its meetings. Official receptions were also held at the castle. Batavia was steeped in European culture, with its small bridges over canals and warehouses along the waterfront. It also boasted numerous European institutions, such as orphanages, churches and hospitals. By 1700 the town had grown enormously: it had 70,000 inhabitants, of whom only 6,000 were of non-Asian origin. Batavia took over Bantam's function as a trading centre in the early 17th century. It became the largest port in Java, and a storage depot for goods from all over Asia. It was also the distribution centre for the money and goods coming out of Europe. Products from the Company's various trading bases were transported to Batavia, and from there they were shipped to Holland. Batavia also played an important role in the trade between the Asian countries. The castle at Batavia was where Company officials met to discuss trade and administrative affairs. It was here that the decisions were made with regard to what the factories and trading posts in Asia needed from the home country, and it was here that the annual reports - the General Missives - were written. VOC trading policies for officials at trading bases was also decided in Batavia. The administrators of this enormous trading network were accountable only to the 'Heeren XVII'. Supreme authority in the VOC in Asia was held by the East Indies Council which was chaired by the Governor General and based in Batavia. The Council served as the link between the different trading bases and the mother country.

Jaquin was een van de meest winstgevende posten van de West-Indische Compagnie aan de Slavenkust. Bekend en geprezen werd het hoofd van de post, Hendrik Hertog; hij stond bekend als een bekwaam handelaar in slaven. Om het handelsgebied uit te breiden onderhandelde Hertog met diverse partijen en mengde hij zich in de plaatselijke politieke strijd. Hij sloot zich echter bij de verkeerde kant aan. In plaats van uitbreiding van Jaquin, werd de vestiging aangevallen. Hertog sloeg in 1732 op de vlucht naar het nabij gelegen eiland Appa. Op het eiland Appa richtte hij vervolgens de bestaande handelspost in als een nieuw slavencentrum. In 1733 wordt wederom in de factorij van Jaquin geïnvesteerd om de handel nieuw leven in te blazen. De hernieuwde factorij krijgt de naam 'Zeelandia'. Hertog weet de handel heel even op te starten. Het WIC-bestuur komt er in 1735 achter dat de door hem ingekochte slaven op de Slavenkust duurder blijken te zijn dan die van de Goudkust, terwijl ze in Suriname dezelfde prijs opbrengen. Dat doet Hertog de das om. Vanaf dat moment worden de slavenschepen weer direct naar Elmina aan de Goudkust gestuurd, in plaats van naar de Slavenkust.

The port town of Japara was one of the first VOC posts on Java (1614). The VOC initially bought rice here to sell on the Spice Islands. During a conflict with the Mataram kingdom in 1618, the VOC factory was attacked. In retaliation, the VOC destroyed the town. The VOC only returned in 1651, when the town became the main VOC post in Mataram. In 1677 the town was the base of operations of the Company's armies, under command of Cornelis Speelman, during the rebellion of Trunajaya against the susuhunan. In 1708 the headquarters of the VOC on the north coast of Java moved to Semarang, and Japara became of lesser importance. Around 1719 the lodige in Japara was replaced with a small fort with four half-bastions, and a small aquare fort was built on the opposite side of the river.

De kolonie Pavonia, een van de eerste permanent bewoonde vestigingen in New Jersey, is een gebied dat tegenwoordig deel uitmaakt van Jersey City en de wijk Hoboken. Pavonia was een zogenaamd patroonschap. Patroonschappen werden door de WIC verleend aan een soort van plantagehouders, met het verschil dat een plantage meestal uit een hoofdhuishouden bestaat en een patroonschap uit huishoudens van ten minste 50 kolonisten.

At the beginning of the 17th century, the VOC attempted to trade Far Eastern spices and other goods for coffee and silver in Jedda. The town fell within the jurisdiction of the VOC resident in Mocha, now Al-Mukha. Disappointing results led the Company to cease trading in Jedda in 1655. However, it did continue to derive revenues from transporting pilgrims there.

Joal was een van de plaatsen aan de kust van het tegenwoordige Senegal, waar de Nederlanders rond 1633 een factorij hadden. Joal werd rond 1678, tegelijkertijd met andere plaatsen in Senegal, zoals Portudal en Rufisque, door de Fransen veroverd op de Nederlanders. Ook Arguin, een klein eiland gelegen in de gelijknamige baai aan de kust van Mauritanië, namen de Fransen over. Hierdoor nam de WIC-handel in Arabische gom, bezoarstenen, grijze amber en struisvogelveren af. Nadat de Fransen het gebied hadden overgenomen, probeerden de Nederlanders hun macht aan de Senegalese kust te herstellen. De leider van de Franse Compagnie du Senegal, de Fransman Jean Ducasse, gooide het op een akkoordje met de plaatselijke machthebbers om te voorkomen dat de Nederlanders weer voet aan wal konden zetten.

Ten noorden van de rivier Paraiba stichtten zij een nederzetting die ter ere van de koning van Spanje en Portugal, Philipz of Filipea werd genaamd, de huidige stad Joao Pessoa. In Paraiba bevonden zich veel 'engenhos', molens waar suiker werd geproduceerd. Bovendien leverde deze streek ook mandioca - het basisvoedsel voor de kolonie-, katoen, tabak en leer. In de omgeving van de plaats bouwden de Portugezen drie forten om de nederzetting te beschermen. Alle drie waren gelegen aan de noordkant, aan de binnenkant van de monding van de rivier Paraiba. Fort Margaretha - eerder genoemd fort Catharina- en fort S. Antonio lagen bij Cabe Dello (Cabedelo), terwijl op het kleine eiland Restingues een klein driehoekig fort gesitueerd was, fort Restinga. In Frederiksstad zelf diende een oud Franciscanenklooster als fortificatie. Er was tevens een toren om de ingang van de haven te verdedigen.

De Joodse Savanne ofwel het 'Joods Dorp', lag stroomopwaarts aan de oostelijke oever van de rivier Suriname. De naam is ontleend aan de vele gevluchte joden die hier kwamen wonen tussen 1650 en 1664. In deze periode werd Nederlands-Brazilië veroverd door de Portugezen, hetgeen vele joden deed vluchten naar andere bestemmingen. Ze trokken naar gebieden rondom de Cayenne en de Suriname rivier, waar Nederlanders gevestigd waren. In Suriname kregen zij van de Engelsen stukken land om te verbouwen. De nieuwkomers bouwden hier in 1665 hun eerste synagoge en tijdens het gouvernement van Sommelsdijck in 1685, een tweede synagoge, opgetrokken uit baksteen. Daarmee werd de plaats voor een lange periode het centrum van de joodse gemeenschap in deze regio. In de loop van de 18de eeuw, toen Paramaribo steeds groter werd als hoofdplaats van de Nederlandse kolonie, werd de Joodse Savanne door vele mensen verlaten in plaats voor een grotere een beter gelegen vestiging aan de monding van de rivier Suriname.

In charge of this residence was a vice merchant who was charged with ensuring that Joana supplied the Company with rice, wood, and to a lesser extent indigo and cotton yarns. The VOC station was situated on the banks of the Joana River, one of the biggest and busiest in Java. The Company redoubt boasted four half bastions which housed rice warehouses, barracks for the troops and the kitchens for the residence.

Pirates occasionally attacked the Portuguese settlements. Sir Francis Drake, an English corsair privateering under a letter of marque granted by the English crown, twice sacked the (then) capital Ribeira Grande in 1585 when it was a part of the Iberian Union.

The inhabitants of Kaibobo are reported to have remained faithful to the VOC from the year 1605, when Castle Victoria on Ambon was conquered. The Company assisted this village against Loehoe, a nearby enemy village, and in exchange it gained permission to conduct free trade with the Kaibobo villagers. Kaibobo was one of the most important native villages on the southern coast of West Ceram. In contrast to most of the rest of Ambon, the residents of Kaibobo were soon converted to Christianity. The local population supplied services to the VOC. The men of Kaibobo were called up in turn to serve at the Zeelandia redoubt on the island of Oma with ten men on average working there per month. The work they were required to do varied, but it mainly comprised building fortifications or supplying the raw materials for construction. Around 1687 the VOC, aided by the local population, built a church in Kaibobo. The town supplied the wood used by the VOC in stockades, or wooden fences, for nearby settlements. Pieter van Dam, who recorded the history of the VOC around 1701, maintains that the village boasted a barricade by the name of Den Bosch, built in 1695.

The garrison at Fort Kalpitya had to ensure that no traders broke the VOC's cinnamon monopoly. The fort's position at the harbour entrance meant that the VOC could blockade Kalpitya harbour. This tactic was also used to put pressure on the king of Kandy when the Company came into conflict with him.

The VOC administration in Ceylon was engaged in a continuous war of attrition with the kingdom of Kandy. This friction came to a head on two occasions: first under Governor Rijcklof van Goens, who aimed to make Ceylon the VOC's central power base in Asia - against the wishes of the king, and indeed against those of Batavia. The second was in 1760, when war broke out between Kandy and the Company. The VOC won this war. Every year delegations from both side visited one another.

In 1652 the VOC sent a delegation to Canton to look into the possibilities for trade there. The court in Peking had repeatedly responded negatively to any overtures from the warlike Dutch, but the merchants in Canton showed more interest. During the 17th century the Company only sailed to Canton occasionally, to buy silk and porcelain. This changed when Europe began drinking tea in the 18th century. In the 18th century the VOC rented permanent premises in Canton, next to the building occupied by the British. Europeans were obliged to do business with the merchants who worked together in organisations known as 'Hongs' with an exclusive licence from the Chinese government to trade with foreigners. However, in spite of the monopoly of the powerful Hongs and the high taxes on trade, the profits that could be made in the tea trade gave the Europeans every reason to remain in Canton. Tea and porcelain were the principal products purchased by the VOC in Canton. For some time the Company sailed directly from Holland to Canton. By cutting out the halfway house in Batavia, where the tea was often stored for long periods of time, the Company was able to supply fresh tea to Europe. But leaving the tea trade to Batavia meant that the VOC was able to pay in China with spices, rather than with silver or with lengths of fabric from the Dutch Republic. European merchants were confined to their warehouses and trading offices along the quay outside the city walls, and were forbidden to enter Canton itself. Through the Hong merchants, the Chinese government exercised a tight control over the foreigners' trade and behaviour. All transactions were carried out through a merchant who was also authorised to collect taxes for the government and to ensure compliance wit the rules. The Europeans had little or no direct contact with the Chinese authorities.

In 1680 Sunan Amangkurat II established his court at Kartasura. At the time, there was a rivalling court at Pleret, ruled by Prins Puger. Both claimed to be the ruler of Mataram. The VOC backed Amangkurat and helped defeat Puger, after which Kartasura became the undisputed capital of Mataram. The kings who reigned from Kartasura were: Amangkurat II (1677-1703), Amangkurat III, Pakubuwana I (1704-1719) and Amangkurat IV (1719-1727). Pakubuwana II (1727-1729 was the last ruler who lived in the palace of Kartasura. In 1742 the Chinese revolted against the sultan, who fled to Ponogoro in West Java. There he got support from the VOC and adipati Cakraningrat of West-Madura. Kartasura was retaken and the rebellion suppressed, but the craton was demolished and no longer sacred Pakubuwana II decided to build a new palace and capital in the village Sala (Solo, Surakarta). On February 17, 1745, the monarch moved to his new craton.

Carta Soura lay in the Javanese interior and was the headquarters of the Susuhunan, the suzerain of the Mataram region in central Java. This sovereign ruled over a large number of regents, who were required to attend the court at Carta Soura once a year. When conflicts arose with these regents, the suzerain applied for the help and protection of the VOC. The Company decided to aid the Susuhunan and despatched 200 soldiers to be stationed at Carta Soera to safeguard the Company's interests and those of the Susuhunan. However, relations between the suzerain and the Company remained in a state of flux.

Shortly after the VOC had established itself on the west coast of Formosa, the Spaniards established a rivalling colony on northern Taiwan. On the island Keelung (now known as Heping Island) they built fort San Salvador. After 1636, when the Spanish governer of the Philippines decided to withdraw most of the Spanish troops from Taiwan, the VOC saw a chance to drive the Spaniards from the island. In 1642, it succeeded in conquering the Spanish forts on northern Taiwan. - In 1662, the VOC abandoned northern Taiwan in the wake of the invasion of Southwestern Taiwan by the Chinese warlord Koxinga. In 1664, during the alliance between the Qing and the VOC, it was briefly re-occupied, and the forts were rebuilt. As the trade with China did not revive, the post was once again abandoned in 1668.

Khambat, or Cambaya, was a moderately sized trading town situated on a river not far from the coast. It was inaccessible for larger vessels as at ebb tide the river virtually ran dry. In 1617 the VOC opened a trading base in Khambat, but this base was permanently manned only until 1634. According to the local inhabitants, the subsequent decline in trade resulted from the arrival of the Dutch and English, who had driven out the Portuguese.

After 1750 the VOC wanted to set up a lodge at Kharg, an island in the north of the Persian Gulf near Basra. In Kareek, as Kharg was also known, Javanese sugar and Indian textiles were offered for sale. A trading post was set up in Khark in fort Mosselsteijn in November 1753. This fort was built between November 1753 and December 1754. However it soon transpired the outpost was unprofitable, partly as a result of the high costs of building and manning the fort there, known as Mosselstein. The VOC left Khark on January 1, 1766 when the fort was handed over to Mir Mohanna, head of the coastal settlement, Bandar-e Rig.

The village of Lauweck in Cambodia was situated along the Mekong River near Phnom Penh and Oudong or Udong, the old capital. As early as 1609 the VOC was already undertaking occasional expeditions from Pattani to Cambodia to buy goods such as deer hides and ray skins, which were in great demand in Japan. The company set up a trading post at Lauweck in 1620, but the trade there proved disappointing, and just two years later the company shut the post down. The Lauweck trading post was reopened on three further occasions, but in 1667 the VOC left Cambodia for good.Besides deer hides and ray skins, Cambodia functioned mainly as a source of provisions for Batavia such as rice, butter, salted pork, and lard. The Company also bought benzoic resin, gum lacquer, ivory and gold, in exchange for which it mostly supplied cotton fabrics.Lauweck was not a busy trading port; the majority of the population made their living from agriculture. Because there was little money in circulation, trading usually took the form of barter.The Company's officials in Cambodia frequently fell victim to attacks, raids and epidemics. As such the VOC was in almost constant negotiation with the king of Cambodia about reparations. In 1644 a VOC delegation sailed up the river to Phnom Penh. Meanwhile a fortified dam with 50 guns was built behind them. The Company suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle but nevertheless resumed relations with Cambodia some ten years later.

Esopus, ofwel Sopus, lag halverwege twee Nederlandse posten: fort Oranje te Beverwijck en fort Amsterdam bij Nieuw-Amsterdam, aan de Hudson rivier. Hier vestigde zich, rond 1652, een groep van ongeveer 60 man. Zij waren afkomstig van het meer noordelijk gelegen fort Oranje. Zij noemden het plaatsje Esopus, naar de Esopus kreek, die uitmondde in de Hudson rivier. De oevers bleken uitermate goed geschikt landbouwgebied, iets dat de Indianen lange tijd terug al hadden ontdekt. De aanvankelijk goede verstandhouding tussen de Indianen en de nieuwkomers veranderde; de zogenaamde Esopus oorlogen braken uit. In 1657 liet Peter Stuyvesant, de directeur-generaal van Nieuw-Nederland, een palissade bouwen rondom het dorp. Hij hernoemde het dorp: Wiltwyck. De naam Kingston kreeg het in pas 1669, onder Engels bewind.

The king of Mataram ruled over his kingdom from the palace in Djokjakarta. Through his conquest of the coastal territories in the 17th century, he controlled virtually all of Java. However, internal divisions and the increasing power of the Company weakened the king's position. He became increasingly dependent on the VOC, which provided the king with military and financial support against his rebellious vassals. In 1743 the king ceded his kingdom to the Company, which thus became the unchallenged ruler of Java.

Koepang on the island of Timor was captured in 1619. Fort Concordia was built in the first half of the 17th century. In 1655 the VOC's headquarters were relocated from Solor to Koepang, otherwise known as Fort Concordia. Koepang was to remain the VOC's headquarters for the Timor region until 1796. Relations between the Company and the Portuguese, who were also based on Timor, were extemely poor. During the 18th century the Company's employees were involved in the torture of the Timor people, while kidnapping and slave trading (which had existed previously) were the order of the day. The garrison fell into a deplorable state. For both the Dutch and the Portuguese, Timor was and remained a settlement of little importance.

De Essequibo (ofwel Isekepe genoemd in de 18de eeuw) rivier ligt in het noorden van Zuid-Amerika, nu Brits Guyana. Al vanaf het begin van de 17de eeuw werd dit gebied door de Nederlanders bevaren. In de loop der tijd ving men aan met de verbouw van suikerriet. Ook werd er handel gedreven in orianeverf, maaraan-olie en diverse houtsoorten. Deze producten werden met de indianen uit het binnenland geruild tegen Europese producten. Aan de Essequibo rivier werd er al in het begin van de 17de eeuw een volksplanting of een patroonschap opgericht door de heer Joost van der Hooge, met de naam Nova Zelandia. Dit soort patroonschappen werden door de WIC verleend aan eigenaren van land, vergelijkbaar met plantagehouders. Met het verschil dat een plantage meestal uit één hoofdhuishouden bestaat en een patroonschap uit veel meer huishoudens. Van der Hooge trof een oudere Portugese versterking aan. Op de poort van het gebouw was het symbool van het Portugese rijk te zien. Van der Hooge herdoopte dit fort met de naam 'fort ter Hooge'. Later kreeg het de naam 'Kijk Overal'. De versterking lag op een klein eiland stroomopwaarts de Essequibo, op de samenvloeiing van de Cayuni en Mazaruni rivier. Vanaf het begin van de 17de eeuw werd deze streek, waar drie rivieren samenvloeien, geweid aan suikerplantages. 3 à 4 plantages behoorden de WIC toe; 12 à 15 aan particuliere planters. Verder stroomopwaarts van de rivier Cayouni schijnt er ook een kleine post te hebben gelegen waar paarden gekocht werden van kooplieden uit Spaans Guyana. Tot 1657 werd er aan deze kolonie geen speciale aandacht geschonken. Pas in 1657 begon een nieuwe fase van kolonisatie van het gebied. In dat jaar werd het bestuur van de regio aan de Directie der Nieuwe Colonie op Isekepe gegeven. Deze directie bestond uit bestuursleden die de steden Middelburg, Veere en Vlissingen vertegenwoordigden. De nieuwe kolonie had vanaf dat moment de naam Nova Zeelandia. Essequibo en Pomeroon werden in 1666 door de Engelsen aangevallen. Pomeroon werd door de Engelsen veroverd en verlaten, maar Essequibo werd teruggewonnen en in 1669 kwam de kolonie rechtsstreek in handen van de WIC. De post Kijk Overal bleef tot 1718 hoofdplaats van de kolonie en zetel van de commandeur. In 1718 werd de hoofdplaats naar de vestiging Cartabo verplaatst, tegenover Fort Kijk Overal, en in 1739 naar fort Zeelandia, op het Vlaggeneiland.

The Tulangbawang is a river in southern Sumatra. During the VOC era it functioned as the border between the districts of Bantam and Palembang. The area supplied the best quality pepper to the VOC. Around 1738 the Company set up an observation post on the Tulangbawang River called Valkenoog or Valkenburg for the surveillance of the Company's pepper shipments. As a result of several local uprisings around 1750 it became impossible for the VOC to store up sufficient pepper for the return trip to the Netherlands. In order to avoid delaying the fleet's departure, the VOC was forced to buy in the far more expensive Malabar pepper.

Towards the end of the 17th century the most farflung outposts of the VOC falling under the Cape of Good Hope were Saldanha Bay in the north, Clapmuts in the north-east and Hottentots Holland in the east. During this period it became imperative the Company extend its borders in order to furnish the free burghers with new land on which to farm. Consequently a valley north east of the Cape was annexed, which became known as ' 't Land van Waveren'. This Waveren valley, as the region was also known, proved suitable for arable farming, livestock and vineyards. Due to problems with the indigenous tribes in the region, the livestock in 't Land van Waveren was driven to the post of Riet Vallei during the winter months, where the cold was less extreme. In 1743 the post was sold to a burgher called P. de Vos in a transaction presided over by the then governor, Swellengrebel. De Vos renamed the town Nooitgedacht.

Fort Henricus on the island of Solor was built by the Portuguese in the second half of the 16th century. The VOC captured the fort in 1613. The settlement at Solor was aimed at controlling or gaining a monopoly on the trade in sandalwood, which was imported from Portuguese East Timor. In 1616 it was abandoned. In September 1618 the territory was occupied once more and the actual fort of Frederik Hendrik (also known as Hendricus or Henricus) was built. In 1628 the fort was abandoned once more, only to be reoccupied in 1646 as a result of The Hague truce, which forced the VOC to define its various territorial claims. From 1655 staffing at the fort was reduced to two woodsmen, or gunners, and in 1760 the fort was finally abandoned altogether.

Laala was a settlement on Hoamoal (Western Seram), a clove-producing region ruled by the <kimelaha>, de ruler of Hoamoal with whom the VOC was periodically in conflict. At the beginning of the Great Ambon War (1651-1656) the VOC's wooden fortification near Laala was taken in a suprise attack. During the subsequent conflict, Laala was heavily fortified with Makasar help. After a siege in September 1654, it was, however, taken in a brutal manner. After the end of the war, the entire peninsula was depopulated and its inhabitants forced to resettle elsewhere.

The latter was a director of the <Noordse Compagnie>, a whaling company operating mostly in the Arctic region around Spitsbergen. Swanendael was one of the first patroonships in New Netherland. The first colonists arrived here in 1631, but the village was destroyed by the indigenous population the next year. - In roughly the same location, a fort was established in 1659 that is generally known as the 'Compagniesfort' The location of the fort was called Whorekill. The surrounding area was bought by the Dutch in 1663, but conquered by the English the next year.

Most of the VOC outposts in Amboina were established in strategic locations in order to protect the clove islands against attack from other European powers. The outposts were also intended as surveillance points to monitor Asian shipping and the island residents. This was aimed at ensuring that the Ambon villagers surrendered their cloves harvest to their village chiefs, who in turn were required to supply the product to the Company. Liang was a native village on the northeastern coast of the island of Ambon, with a redoubt. In 1635 110 men were stationed at the redoubt.

Vanaf het begin van de 17de eeuw had de WIC een loge in Loango-Boary, een post gelegen in de regio ten noorden van de Congo rivier, ook wel bekend als Loango. Tot 1670 handelden de Nederlanders hier in ivoor en koper. Ook al werd vanaf 1670 de slavenhandel in dit gebied meer lucratief, de handel in zijn totaliteit bleek voor de Compagnie een tegenvaller. De loge werd rond 1684 verlaten. In 1721 besloot de WIC de loge te heropenen, maar ongeveer vijf jaar later werd het door de lokale bevolking ingenomen.

São Paolo de Loanda was het grootste Portugese slavendepot aan de Afrikaanse kust. In 1641 veroverden de Nederlanders de stad Loanda aan de kust van Angola. De veroveraars herdoopten het Portugese fort met de naam Aardenburgh. Al eerder deed de WIC in 1624 een poging Loanda te veroveren, maar door onvoldoende manschappen en schepen mislukte de aanval. Tussen 1641 en 1648 beheerden de Nederlanders er de slavenhandel. In deze periode werd het gebied Loango-Angola bestuurd door een gouverneur die in São Paolo de Loanda zijn zetel had en niet vanuit Elmina, waar de WIC haar hoofdbestuur voor de Afrikaanse westkust had.Het gebied bleek eerder verlies dan winst op te leveren: Tussen 1641 en 1648 werden er slechts 14.000 slaven uit Loanda getransporteerd.

Luhu was traditionally the residence of the <kimelaha>, the ruler of Hoamoal (Western Seram), who officially ruled the area in the name of Ternate. As such, the VOC had a fraught relationship with Luhu: in times of peace there was a fortified trading post. However, due to shifting VOC policy and the regular tensions and conflicts with the <kimelaha>, it was often abandoned. During the Great Ambon War, there was ample fighting around Luhu, for example in 1654, when the VOC wanted to destroy the sago groves growing near the river Kahouli. At the end of the war, the entire peninsula was depopulated, and the people living there forced to relocate.

The island of Mauritius was used by Dutch ships as a staging post from the end of the 16th century, but it was not until 1637 that the 'Heeren XVII' decided the Company should take possession of the island. A fort was built and manned by 50 to 80 VOC employees, as well as slaves, exiles and convicts. In 1657 the 'Hooge regeering' (Supreme Government) of the VOC in Batavia decided to abandon the island and transfer the population to the Cape of Good Hope. However, in the face of looming French competition the Company decided in 1664 to reoccupy the base. In 1710 the island was left for good. Mauritius was highly suitable as a staging post because it was exceptionally fertile. The island also had a wealth of bird life - including the dodo - as well as turtles and manatees, which were hunted on a large scale. Pigs, deer and goats were also left behind on the island as livestock. The island was particularly important as a source of ebony, large quantities of which were felled in the interior. Plantations were established producing sugar cane, rice, vegetables and fruit.

The trade entrepot of Makassar played an important role in intra-Asian trade in the 17th century and as such proved a formidable competitor for Batavia as a trading centre in the early 17th century. The trade centred on cloves, nutmeg and mace imported from the Molucca Islands, Ambon and Banda. From 1607 the VOC had a trading base in Makassar, where it focused initially on trade in cloves. From 1615 onwards, Makassar and the VOC increasingly got into conflict as the VOC tried to impose a spice monopoly in the Moluccas. The state of Gowa-Tallo, of which Makassar was the capital, supported wars and rebellions in the Moluccas that stood up to the VOC's monopolistic ambitions with regard to the spices produced there. Makassar itself became an important trading city in these same spices, selling to both European and Asian traders, thus thwarting Dutch monopolistic ambitions. In a series of conflicts, the VOC was increasingly able to keep the traders operating from Makassar from accessing the spices. After a surprise attack in 1660, it was able to force the rulers to evict the large Portuguese community. In 1667-1669, in cooperation with its local ally, Arung Palakka, it definitively managed to break the power of Gowa-Tallo, and install their ally Arung Palakka as the most powerful ruler of the region. This ended Makasar involvement in the spice trade. The VOC kept the Makasar fortification Ujung Pandang for itself, turning it into Fort Rotterdam, and a Dutch quarter arose in its vicinity. From this situation, Makassar would gradually attain the character of a VOC colony, and would become a 'gouvernement' in the 18th century.

The island of Makian in the North Molucca Islands had a good harbour and was well-planted with clove trees. In 1608 the VOC captured it from the Spanish and gave to the sultan of Ternate on condition that all the cloves should be supplied to the VOC. Here, as on the other islands of the Moluccas, the local population suffered under the violent measures used by the VOC to protect its trade monopoly. Illegally planted clove trees would be felled by VOC workers during so-called 'hongi raids', while supplying cloves to foreign merchants other than those of the VOC carried a heavy penalty.

Malembo was een van de plaatsen aan de Angolese kust die de WIC in 1641 veroverde op de Portugezen. Het was tevens een van de laatste plaatsen aan de Angolakust die de WIC behield. Omdat de handel voor een lange tijd geen grote winsten opleverde, besloten de bewindhebbers van de WIC de handelspost in 1684 te sluiten. De handel (ivoor, koper, verfhout en slaven) werd vanaf dat moment direct vanaf de schepen gevoerd.

After conquering the area in 1658 the Company finished it and turned it into a Protestant church. However, Protestantism failed to take root in the area: the congregation remained small and religious education in the local school was not very successful.

The mutual relations between the VOC and the inhabitants of the island were generally bad, and the island was the target of several Dutch military expeditions in the course of the 17th century. - Manipa was deliberately destroyed ecologically at the beginning of the Great Ambon War (1651-1656): in retaliation for the surprise attacks on VOC posts in March 1651, of which the one on Manipa was the most brutal, the island was turned into “an eternal wasteland” by cutting all the trees that were useful to the human population of the island. At the end of the war, the remaining inhabitants were forced to resettle around the Dutch fort Wantrouw on the south coast of the island.

The VOC captured the island of Mannar in 1658. Mannar was one of the last Portuguese strongholds in Ceylon and the Portuguese put up a strong defence, but to no avail. The VOC secured the island and for the time being it ruled supreme in Ceylon, unchallenged by any of its European competitors. The island of Mannar lay close to the Indian coast. A visitor in 1658 called it an earthly paradise. The fort had every convenience; each of the soldiers had a young Ceylonese servant to look after his weaponry, and a woman to prepare his meals. The Company introduced Protestantism here. Mannar was a rich island. Particularly profitable was the trade in pearls which were plentiful in the waters around the island. Pearl fishing was organised on a major scale under the strict supervision of the VOC. In addition Mannar was a source of cotton and clothing, red textile dye, fish and elephants. The fort at Mannar played a key role in the defence of the sea route to India and the VOC's trading interests. Built by the Portuguese, the fort remained largely unchanged under the Company.

According to the author Pieter van Dam, the VOC maintained a so-called 'comptoir' in Martavaan some 40 years before he embarked on his history of the Company, 'Beschryvinge van de Oostindische Compagnie'. This would date the settlement around 1660. However this trading post on the West Coast of Birma was soon abandoned due to a ban imposed by the local ruler.

It became a french territory in the 1635, in spite of a revolt of the indigenous Carib population the following year. Many early settlers were Huguenots, seeking greater religious freedom overseas, and as a consequence, the French crown briefly deported Huguenots who refused to convert here in the years 1686-1688. In spite of the Crown's efforts, it remained strongly Huguenot. - Martinique changed hands between the British and French several times during the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars, but it was ultimately traded back to France and remains a French overseas territory to this day.

Gouverneur Willem Kieft, die naarstig op zoek was naar mensen die zich wilden vestigen in de omgeving van Nieuw-Amsterdam, gaf in 1642 de Engelse dominee Francis Doughty toestemming om een dorpje te stichten op het Lange Eiland, oftewel Long Island, dat viel onder Nederlands bewind. Dominee Doughty noemde het dorp Maspeth. Al een jaar na de stichting vielen Indianen het dorp aan. Zo kwam snel een einde aan het dorp Maspeth. Echter, negen jaar later probeerde een nieuwe Engelse groep het opnieuw. Zij noemden de plaats Middleburgh. Toen Engeland het hele gebied Nieuw-Nederland in 1664 overnam kreeg de plaats haar derde naam: Hastings. Maar de bewoners van het dorp zelf noemden de plaats Newtown. Het dorp is opgeslokt in de tegenwoordige wijk Queens.

Matara was a major bonded warehouse in southern Ceylon. The principal commodities were elephants and cinnamon. Elephants were captured by chasing them into a trap, from which they could be removed one by one and tied up. Subsequently the elephants would be baptised in accordance with Ceylonese custom. A wild elephant would be put in with tame ones. The elephants were sold to Indian rajahs who deployed them in times of war as living tanks. The VOC exercised territorial authority in Matara and could therefore levy taxes. A tightening of the tax regulations in 1760 sparked an uprising against the VOC by the local population. The rebels were aided by the king of Kandy, with whom the VOC had for some time been in conflict. The Company won the war, but suffered a great loss of prestige. For this reason a bigger fort was subsequently built in Matara.

In 1630, toen de Nederlanders het Braziliaanse eiland Antonio Vaz (een eiland dat gelegen was naast Recife en tegenwoordig een wijk is met de naam Santo Antonio) op de Portugezen veroverden, troffen zij er een klein bolwerk, een klooster en enkele huizen aan. Het klooster werd ingenomen en de Nederlanders besloten drie nieuwe forten te bouwen om Recife, dat nieuwe hoofdstad werd van Nederlands-Brazilië, beter te kunnen verdedigen tegen mogelijke aanvallen uit de Varzéa, de streek landinwaarts waar de meeste Portugezen naar toe waren gevlucht.Deze forten waren: fort Waardenburgh, fort Frederik Hendrick en fort Ernestus. Bij dit laatste fort werd het bestaande klooster van Santo Antonio geïncorporeerd. Omdat Recife langzamerhand overbevolkt raakte, werd er vanaf 1638 aan de uitbreiding van de stad op het nabijgelegen eiland gewerkt. Na de verwoesting van de nabijgelegen stad Olinda - de hoofdstad van de Portugezen -, werden de stenen en materialen van het afbreken hergebruikt om Mauritsstad op te richten, de nieuwe naam van het eiland Antonio Vaz. Men begon met het noordelijke gedeelte van het eiland. Er ontstonden grachten en kanalen, nieuwe straten, de eerste residentie voor de gouverneur Johan Maurits, de grote markt, het stadhuis, koopmanskantoren, magazijnen, een wapenhuis en kerken. Vanaf 1640 werden aan de zuidelijke kant van Mauritsstad een gerechtshof, een ziekenhuis, een armen- en weeshuis gebouwd. In 1644 werd Mauritsstad aan het vaste land (tegenwoordig de wijk Boavista) verbonden met een brug over de rivier Capibaribe. Het oude Recife werd toegankelijk door een tweede brug over de rivier Beberibe, bekend als de Mauritsbrug. Later werden er nog enkele kleine forten en redoutes gebouwd, een nieuw paleis voor de gouverneur (paleis Boa vista ofwel Schoonzicht). Tegenwoordig is het oude Mauritsstad een wijk van de grotere stad Recife. In 1654 gaven de Nederlanders zich over aan de Portugezen, en zo raakten Mauritsstad en Recife weer onder Portugees bewind.

According to Hartsink's history of Guyana (see under documentation), the 'island of Mecoria' was the site of a Dutch coloy from 1634 tot 1636, which had been founded on the private initiative of Jan Bicker, without the consent of the WIC. The Dutch found an abandoned French fortification there, which they restored and used during their short-lived presence in the area. - In this description, Mecoria is situated between the Cayenne and Wia rivers (the latter probably denoting the Mahury), i.e. east of the Cayenne river. Interestingly, the region of the <west> bank of the Cayenne is still called Macouria.

Meidorp lag aan de rivier Benin (ook wel Rio Formoso genaamd) in het koninkrijk met dezelfde naam. Hier had de WIC een loge om handel te drijven. De naam is waarschijnlijk te danken aan een van de Nederlandse kooplieden die hier werkzaam was. De loge werd verlaten omdat de laatste koopman, ene Beelsnijder, brutaal was opgetreden tegen de bevolking die zich vervolgens tegen hem keerde. Hierdoor werd verder verblijf van Nederlanders onmogelijk.

Malacca had long served as an international depot and played an important role in intra-Asian trade. It was no coincidence that the Malay language became the lingua franca of the Malay-Indonesian archipelago. The VOC cast its eye on Malacca in the early 17th century, seeing it as an ideal sentry post on the Malacca Straits to guarantee the safety of VOC ships carrying valuable cargoes between the East and West. In 1641 the VOC captured Malacca, thereby ending 128 years of Portuguese occupation. With its fall, the last Portuguese stronghold in the Malay-Indonesian archipelago was eliminated. This occasioned a dramatic shift in the political balance of power in the region. The significant rise in the Company's prestige enabled it to strengthen its monopoly of the spice trade. In 1786 Van Braam's fleet relieved Malacca after defeating the Bouginese. These sea-faring people, originally from Celebes, caused tremendous problems for the VOC in the Strait of Malacca. Threatened by the Bouginese, Kedah and Siak sought the protection of the VOC. Even before the VOC opened its trading post in Malacca, there was already an extremely varied trade in products from the Malay peninsula. Immediately after the conquest of Malacca in 1641, the VOC set out to achieve the tried and trusted weapon of monopoly. It attempted to persuade the sultans, willingly or unwillingly, to supply the VOC with various products. The Company's main interest was in tin, which was obtained from Perak, inland. The Malaccan territory comprised the coast of the Malay peninsula, the Riouw Lingga archipelago, the kingdom of Indragiri on the coast of Sumatra and Siak. The governor was based in Malacca town. In 1795, Malacca fell to the English.

The rulers of Moti received 375 guilders from the VOC each year to cut down clove trees. In this way the VOC attempted to maintain control of all clove production and trading in the Molucca Islands.

In de plaats Mouri, gelegen tussen Apam en Elmina aan de Goudkust, werd in 1612 fort Nassau gebouwd. Het fort is genoemd naar prins Maurits van Nassau. De oprichter van het fort was Jacob Adriaensz. Clantius, die in opdracht van de admiraliteit van Amsterdam naar de Goudkust was getrokken om daar de Nederlandse handelsbelangen veilig te stellen. Tot 1624, dus een paar jaar na de oprichting van de WIC in 1621, behoorde dit fort toe aan de Nederlandse staat. Daarna ging het over in handen van de WIC. In dezelfde periode werd het fort verbouwd. Volgens Barbot, die het fort beschreef, had de gouverneur er een tuin, die als mooiste van de hele Goudkust werd beschouwd.Aanvankelijk stonden de Nederlanders in Mouri op goede voet met de plaatselijke vorst van Sabou. Toen de Nederlanders zich echter zo sterk hadden gemaakt dat zij ter plaatse de wet konden uitmaken, ving de vorst aan met verzet tegen hen.

The island of Mozambique was the Portuguese waystation where ships heading for Goa or other places on the Indian coast usually called. This port of call was perhaps even more important to the Portuguese than the Cape was to the VOC, as Goa could only be reached for a few months a year, at the end of the winter monsoon. Many Portuguese ships had to 'winter' in Mozambique to await that moment, or sometimes didn't make it to Goa in time and were mercilessly blown back to Mozambique. In the spring of 1662, the VOC sent a fleet from the Netherlands to conquer Mozambique, but due to the turning of the monsoon and cyclones, the fleet was unable to reach the island and ultimately abandoned its mission.

The Portuguese introduced Catholicism to Mukamelay in the 16th century. When the Company took over they substituted Protestantism for Catholicism. A pedestal which had borne the Roman Catholic crucifix remained flanking the church entrance for some time. VOC preachers, Calvinists with an aversion to Roman Catholic symbols, had ordered the cross be removed.

The VOC governor of Ceylon commissioned the Dutch artist Arent Jansen to draw the area c. 1635. The results are handed down to us in the form of several engravings by Johann Wolfgang Heydt, who worked after Jansen's now-lost drawings. - The rock was called Adamsberg (Adam's mountain) at the time. This should not be confused with the present-day Adam's Peak, which is located further to the north.

Mullaitivu was a remote VOC outpost on the northern coast of Ceylon, situated on the Bay of Bengal. The Company built a simple fort here, of which no trace remains. The primary function of this settlement was to combat the smuggling trade between Kandy and southern India. The smugglers concentrated on the export of elephants and the import of cotton to Ceylon. Around 1775 a fort was built at Mullaitivu that was subsequently captured by the British.

In the centre of Mullipattu stood a church and a school where the local inhabitants were given religious instruction. These schools not only had an important role to play in the propagation of the Protestant faith, but also functioned as centres for a detailed registration of the local population. The records kept by teachers of their pupils gave the VOC an insight into the people under its authority. Because the area verged on the border with the territory ruled by the king of Ceylon, the Company also built a small fort at Mullipattu.

Maskate, now Muscat, on the coast of Oman, controlled access to the Persian Gulf. The town was ringed by a protective wall and guarded by three forts. The Arabs drove the Portuguese out of Maskate in 1650. The Company decided that to try and capture this strategically important town involved too great a risk. VOC ships called regularly at Maskate to trade or for safe anchorage. After 1660 the Dutch captured many Portuguese settlements along the coast of India, thereby bolstering the VOC's position on the key sea route between Persia and India. In Maskate the VOC maintained contacts with local traders in 1651 and later in 1666. The Imam of Maskate invited the Company to start a trading office in the city, but it was to take until 1672 before the base actually opened. The trade proved somewhat disappointing given that the Omanis traded the same wares as the Dutch. Only in 1672 did the VOC establish a trading post (a rented house). Just three years later the post was abandoned once more.

The fishing village of Myleddi had its own church and school.

The VOC besieged the Portuguese at Negapatnam and captured the town in 1658. On the advice of Commissioner-General Van Rheede the town was made the Company's headquarters on the Coromandel Coast. He constructed an enormous fortress, where a sizeable force was garrisoned. However this major investment did little to render the trading activities here profitable. From 1687 onwards Nagappattinam functioned as the governor of Coromandel's residence until the town fell to the English in 1781. The residence of the governor subsequently reverted to Pulicat, its base prior to 1687.

During the course of the 17th century Japan cut all its contacts with the rest of the world. The VOC, which had been based on the island of Hirado until 1641, was forced to relocate to the small island of Deshima in the bay of Nagasaki. Well into the 19th century, the Company's employees were the only foreigners permitted to set foot on Japanese soil. However, their stay on Deshima, like the trade they did there, was subject to strict control by the Japanese government. The trade with Japan was especially important in the 17th century, when the VOC purchased large quantities of silver, gold and copper there in exchange for deer hides from Formosa, Chinese silk, and spices from the Indonesian archipelago. Towards the end of the 17th century, however, Japan began to become concerned about the enormous quantities of precious metals that were disappearing in this way. As a result of the numerous restrictions that were subsequently imposed, the number of VOC ships sailing to Deshima dwindled in the 18th century. Deshima was a small artificial island whose northern shore was linked to the town of Nagasaki by a stone bridge. VOC officials were only allowed to leave Deshima for the annual state visit to the court of the Shogun in Edo, and the occasional excursion under Japanese supervision. Conversely, the Japanese were not allowed onto Deshima, with the exception of a few officials, interpreters and Japanese ladies of pleasure. In Japan the official in charge of trade was the 'opperhoofd' or supervisor, while the 'opperkoopman' or senior merchant headed the trading base. In the 17th century the trading post in Deshima was the largest supplier of precious metals in Asia. However, after 1672 the governor of Nagasaki established fixed prices for imported goods, and the export of silver was forbidden. As a result the trade in Japan became progressively less profitable for the VOC, but smuggling blossomed. During the course of the 18th century trade between private individuals in Japan gradually gained the upper hand. Unlike elsewhere in Asia, in Japan the VOC was completely subject to the local authority. The VOC had learned that it could only achieve anything in Japan if it was prepared to ask on bended knee - literally. Illustrative of this state of affairs was the way the annual state visit to the Shogun in Edo was organised. These visits, which took two months, cost the VOC vast amounts of money. In addition to the valuable gifts for the Shogun, the Company had to pay in advance for the non-negotiable prices of inns, bearers, interpreters and provisions. After 1641 an 'opperhoofd' or supervisor was based at Deshima in charge of VOC trade with Japan. The Japanese Shogun decreed that the supervisor and his staff were only permitted to stay on Deshima for one year.

Nagelwanze was situated in the Coromandel interior on a tributary of the Khrishna about halfway between Masulipatnam and Golconda. The village population numbered many weavers, textile sellers and farmers. Goods and textiles were collected and stored at the VOC's trading post. In 1670 the Company started construction of a lodge in the centre of the village. The head of the lodge was referred to as a chief.

Nallur was situated several kilometres outside Jaffna. A seminary funded entirely by the VOC opened there in 1692. Large numbers of Ceylonese attended. This was mainly a reflection of the VOC's policy decision in 1690 to employ only those locals who were proficient in Dutch. Besides offering religious education, the seminary aimed to turn its pupils into 'little Dutchmen'. It closed in 1722.

Iets ten noorden van de rivier Rio Grande lag volgens Nieuhoff een klein stadje genaamd Amsterdam. Aan de monding van deze grote rivier lag de kleine nederzetting Natal en het Portugese fort Tres Reis (Magos). Het fort werd in 1633, onder leiding van Matias Ceulen, door een Nederlandse expeditie ingenomen. Hij veranderde de naam in fort Ceulen. Het fort lag op een heuvel en was omsingeld door water. Het fort, met hoge stenen muren, werd later door de Nederlanders versterkt. Hoewel de bemanning van het fort zich in 1650 overgaf aan de Portugezen, bleef het gebied Rio Grande tot 1654 onder Nederlands gezag.

The VOC waged a long and fierce battle against the Portuguese for Negombo. When the Company overthrew the fort for the second time, the Portuguese soldiers refused to surrender, so they were all killed. The VOC was determined to drive all its European competitors out of Ceylon. Negombo played a strategically important role in the VOC's cinnamon trade. The local inhabitants themselves primarily made a living from fishing. Initially the VOC was dependent for its supply of cinnamon on the harvest from the jungles belonging to the king of Kandy - with whom the Company was at war during the second half of the 17th century. The king concentrated his attacks the VOC's economic interests by pillaging farms and forcing large numbers of people to move. One of the places he attacked was Negombo.

De strijd om de Delaware Rivier tussen de Nederlanders en de Zweden, kwam tot een hoogtepunt toen Peter Stuyvesant directeur-generaal werd Nieuw-Nederland in 1647. Zijn voorganger, Willem Kieft, had de relaties met de Zweden vriendelijk weten te houden. Hij was zich ervan bewust dat zijn echte vijanden de Engelsen waren en niet de Zweden. In de zomer van 1651 werd fort Casimir gebouwd op bevel van Peter Stuyvesant. Een aantal Nederlandse gezinnen, dat eerder woonde in de omgeving van fort Nassau en fort Beversreden, vestigde zich bij fort Casimir. In 1645 telde het dorpje al 21 huizen. De Zweden namen het fort echter al snel na de bouw in en hernoemden het fort Drie-eenheid. In 1655 kwam Stuyvesant terug met een grote militaire macht waarmee hij het fort heroverde en een einde bracht aan de Zweedse macht in het gebied. Stuyvesant besloot in de directe omgeving van het fort een nieuw dorpje te stichten dat hij Nieuw-Amstel noemde. In 1656 werd het dorp en het land eromheen verkocht aan de stad Amsterdam, aangezien de WIC moeite had met het beheren van de plaats vanwege economische verliezen.Onder Engels bewind werd Nieuw-Amstel herdoopt in New Castle; het fort werd door de Engelsen Delaware genoemd.

De eerste bewoners van de stad waren met name Walen uit de Zuidelijke Nederlanden: protestantse gezinnen die wegens hun geloof naar Leiden gevlucht waren. Op Manhattan werden acht mensen uit deze groep aan land gezet. Zij namen het eiland in mei 1624 officieel voor de West-Indische Compagnie in bezit. Het jaar daarop volgde een verse groep Waalse kolonisten. Op 2 februari 1653 kreeg Nieuw-Amsterdam stadsrechten. In dat jaar telde de kersverse stad ongeveer 800 inwoners. Fort Amsterdam of Nieuw-Amsterdam werd waarschijnlijk tussen 1625 en 1626 gebouwd. In 1628, toen bleek dat de wallen uit te los zand bestonden, werd aangevangen met de bouw van een nieuw fort op dezelfde locatie. Hiervoor gebruikte men steen. In '29 was het voltooid, maar ook dit nieuwe fort liet, volgens talloze commentaren van tijdgenoten, te wensen over. Binnen de stenen fortmuren was de St. Nicolaaskerk gebouwd.Het fort was vanaf de stichting tot aan het moment van overgave aan de Engelsen in 1664, het centrum van het WIC-bestuur in Nieuw-Nederland. Manhatten, het eiland waarop de nieuwe stad lag, kent nog steeds sporen van de nieuwkomers: Wallstreet waar vroeger de stadswal lag; Broadway (van de Brede Weg); Harlem (van Haarlem). Haarlem, ook op Manhattan, was de tweede vestiging van de WIC op dit eiland.

The post of Nieuwland (Newlands) dates back to 1656 when Commander Van Riebeeck attempted to supply the Company with grain using the Cape's own resources. He ordered that the lands behind Table Mountain be tested as to their suitability for growing barley and oats. The experimental crops showed the region was suited to a more ambitious agricultural project. In 1658 a large grain store was built there.

The island of Makian in the North Molucca Islands had a good harbour and was well-planted with clove trees. In 1608 the VOC captured it from the Spanish and gave to the sultan of Ternate on condition that all the cloves should be supplied to the VOC. Here, as on the other islands of the Moluccas, the local population suffered under the violent measures used by the VOC to protect its trade monopoly. Illegally planted clove trees would be felled by VOC workers during so-called 'hongi raids', while supplying cloves to foreign merchants other than those of the VOC carried a heavy penalty.

Aan de rivier Pomeron of Poumeron, in het noorden van Zuid-Amerika, vestigde zich in 1657 een groep Zeeuwen afkomstig van de steden Middelburg, Veere en Vlissingen. De kolonie, ook wel bekend als Nova Zeelandia ofwel Isekepe, bestond uit enkele posten gelegen aan de twee oevers van de rivieren Pomeroon en Essequibo. De vestigingen aan de Pomeroon waren Nieuw Middelburg en het fort Zeelandia, ook wel Nova Zeelandia genaamd, en een post aan de Moruka Kreek. De vestiging Nieuw Middelburg lag aan de oostelijke oever van de Pomeroon rivier, landinwaarts. Niet ver van het plaatsje Nieuw Middelburg had men ook een klein fortje gebouwd genaamd 'Huis ter Hooge'. Nieuw Middelburg werd beschouwd als de hoofdplaats van de kolonie aan de Pomeroon rivier. In de kolonie werden vrij snel na de stichting ervan plantages aangelegd voor het planten van suikerriet. De posten aan de Pomeroon rivier waren geen lang leven beschoren. In 1666, toen de Engelsen onder leiding van majoor John Scott de kolonie aanvielen, werden de posten en plantage geplunderd en uiteindelijk veroverd.

In 1627, the Dutch settled at the mouth of the Berbice river, but until the end of the 17th century this colony, now British Guyana, was of little significance to the WIC. Upriver several posts were erected. An initial wooden fort, at a location on the Wironje Creek, was built by the colonists to defend themselves against the attacks of the indigenous population. Later this post would be abandoned to found a new fort slightly downstream, which would become known as Fort Nassau. The posts were situated near the plantations, most of which cultivated sugar, although some coffee and cotton was also grown. Some plantations specialized in cassave, the staple food for the indigenous population, and, increasingly, the colonists. Around the fort a settlement of some 25 or 30 houses soon developed. In the course of time the place became known as New Amsterdam, which formed the heart of the plantation colony. The fort housed the seat of government of Berbice. The fort was reinforced with a palissade and equipped with some cannon. Inside the fort, a large building served both as a warehouse and as garrison quarters, with the officers living upstairs. During a slave revolt in 1763 this post, like many along the Berbice river, was abandoned, the population seeking refuge at the fortification at Sint Andries, at the estuary of the Berbice river. After the revolt was suppressed, attempts were made to found a new headquarters near the destroyed fort Nassau, for which elaborate plans were drawn up. After the colony was successively occupied by the English and the French (between 1780 and 1784) these plans were abandoned, and it was decided to found a new seat of government near fort Sint Andries, at the estuary of the Berbice River. This town would similarly be called New Amsterdam.

From 1627 onwards the Dutch colonized the area around the estuary of the Berbice river, nowadays in British Guyana. Straight across from an island named Crab Island, on the east bank of the river, the Dutch built a stone fort ringed with a palissade, named Fort Andries, after the governor of the colony Johan Andries Lossener, who ruled the colony from 1732 onwards. The fort would gain in importance after 1763, when a slave revolt drove many of the inhabitants of the colony's headquarters, located upriver near Fort Nassau, down to this region, to seek protection at Fort Andries. After 1785, the new capital of Berbice was founded here. It was named New Amsterdam, just like the now abandoned headquarters further upriver.

Towards the end of the 18th century an increasing number of outposts were established to the east. Niguasbos, with its extensive wood forests, was one. Mostly woodcutters were stationed there and in addition to the local commander the outpost usually boasted a smith and a wagonmaker.

As such, it became a center of anti-Dutch resistance in several of the conflicts in the first half of the 17th century, until, in the wake of the Great Ambon War, it was evacuated and demolished. Beneath the hill, the Dutch built a blockhouse named Velsen in 1655. Beneath the hill on which Ihamahu had been situated, was the village of Nollot, which was known for its metal industry.

Het WIC-kantoor te Offra werd rond 1660 opgericht. Volgens een rapport uit 1670 zouden de Nederlanders jaarlijks zo'n 2.500 tot 3.000 slaven uit Offra transporteren. Als de verhoudingen tussen de verenigde rijken in de omgeving van de Slavenkust niet gespannen waren, betekende dat een goede aanvoer van slaven vanuit het binnenland naar de kust. De machtsstrijd die ontstond tussen de binnenlandse Aja-vorst van Allada en de vorsten van de kuststreek, zorgde ervoor dat vanaf 1688 de slavenaanvoer werd bemoeilijkt. Na vier jaar, als de WIC zich inmiddels in de strijd heeft gemengd en waarschijnlijk de kant van de Aja-vorst heeft gekozen, wordt kantoor te Offra verwoest. Hierdoor trok de Compagnie zich in 1692 - tijdelijk - terug van de Slavenkust. In 1703 hernieuwen de Nederlanders de handel aan de slavenkust, nu in de plaats Ouidah. Volgens Bosman, die een uitgebreide beschrijving opstelde van dit gebied, werd Offra ook wel Klein Ardra genoemd. Er bestond ook een 'Groot Ardra', of Allada, dat was de hoofdstad van het koninkrijk Dahomey, een in het binnenland van de Slavenkust gelegen rijk.

Olinda was de Portugese hoofdstad van Pernambuco, de rijkste capitania (provincie) van Brazilië. In dit gewest werden grote hoeveelheden suiker geproduceerd. Het was daardoor één van de meest bevolkte streken in Brazilië. Pernambuco strekte zich uit van de rivier São Francisco in het zuiden tot het gewest Itamaracá in het noorden. Alle dorpen en nederzettingen concentreerden zich langs de kust en dicht bij de monding van de rivieren. Toen de Nederlanders Pernambuco in 1630 innamen, was Olinda een welvarend stadje dat ongeveer 700 huizen telde en veel kerken, kloosters en mooie gebouwen kende. Op het moment dat Olinda door de Portugezen gesticht werd, was het voor hen van belang om de plaats tegen aanvallen van de Indianen te verdedigen. De nederzetting was gelegen op de heuvels ten noorden van het vissersdorp Recife, een lang en smal schiereiland. Omdat de Nederlanders de versterkingen van de stad in slechte staat aantroffen, werd besloten de stad te 'ontmantelen' en een nieuwe nederzetting op te richten in Recife, een dorp met toegang tot de zee, iets ten zuiden van Olinda. In Olinda bleven nog enkele Portugese families met hun personeel achter. Langzamerhand werd Olinda verlaten voor Recife, dat uitgroeide tot de hoofdstad van Nederlands-Brazilië. In 1630 werd ook het Portugese fort aan het strand van São Francisco, genaamd forte Queijo, door de Nederlanders verbouwd. Het fort was een jaar eerder onder leiding van de Portugees Mathias de Alburquerque gebouwd om de stad te verdedigen.

The sailing ships of the VOC needed much repair and maintenance after their arrival in Asia, during their stay in tropical waters and before their return to Europe. The ship was careened to clean and repair the hull. Before Batavia the coast was too shallow to do this work. On 14 kilometer of shore lies a group of coral islands in deep water. The biggest island of 12 hectare was already in 1614 – before the foundation of Batavia – used for the maintenance of the ships. The Dutch called the island Onrust (Restless) because the work continued night and day and never stopped. On Onrust permanent buildings like a forge and workshops were built, and expanded in the course of the 17th century. By the 18th century Onrust, with two sawmills, a big forge, workshops, warehouses, cranes and more than 1000 laborers, was the biggest and most advanced shipyard in Southeast Asia. In 1795 the Dutch demolished the fort and the main part of the buildings on Onrust. In 1800 the British burned down the remaining buildings. Between 1980 and 1995 archaeological research was done on Onrust. Today the island is a protected monument. The historic park with the buildings of the quarantine station, foundation of the VOC fort, graveyard and museum attracts many visitors from Jakarta.

Het fort lag op een steile rots van '150 stappen hoog' tussen de bovenstad en de benedenstad (wat nu Oranjestad is), daar waar de Fransen eerder al een fortje hadden gebouwd. In der loop der tijd viel het fort in handen van Fransen en Engelsen en Nederlanders, die om beurten veranderingen aan het fort aanbrachten. Toen de Nederlanders in 1689 er in slaagden het eiland wederom te veroveren, besloten zij het door de Engelsen verwoeste fort te herbouwen. Rondom het fort groeide de vestiging uit tot de centrale nederzetting van het eiland. In de 18de eeuw werd er een gereformeerde kerk en een synagoge, de 'Hohen Dalim' gebouwd, die tot de dag van vandaag getuigen van de aanwezigheid van Nederlanders. Rond 1781, tijdens de Engelse bezetting van het eiland St. Eustatius of wellicht later tijdens de Franse bezetting, werd de batterij De Bouillé ofwel Citeon of Citern gebouwd. Deze batterij was gelegen ten zuiden van de bovenstad, later Oranjestad. De naam van deze batterij zal waarschijlijk afkomstig zijn van de marquis De Bouillé die in november 1781 het eiland overnam van de Engelsen.

Rond 1686-89, besloten de Nederlanders op St. Eustatius tevens een nieuw fort te ontwerpen aan de Oranjebaai, genaamd ' Waterfort' of fort Amsterdam. Het fort, dat aanvankelijk met 16 kannonen opgeleverd werd, verviel heel snel. Later besloot de Compagnie het weer in gebruik te nemen als pakhuis, waar ook tijdelijk slaven verbleven. Het fort bleef tot ca. 1780 in gebruik, naast fort Oranje, en lag aan het strand, in de benedenstad van Oranjestad. Volgens Bubberman zou er op deze plek in 1709 een nieuw fort gebouwd zijn die het Waterfort zou vervangen, maar of dat fort Hollandia is, dat ook als nieuw fort wordt aangeduid is niet helemaal duidelijk. Rondom de Oranjebaai werden er in de loop der jaren meerdere forten en batterijen door de Nederlanders aangelegd. Iets ten noorden van de baai, op de rand van een heuvel lag batterij Roijaal. Uit de inventaris uit 1784 van commandeur Oyen blijkt deze batterij vóór 1784 gebouwd moet zijn, tijdens de Engelse en Franse bezetting van Sint Eustatius. Andere forten waren fort Rotterdam, ten noordoosten van het Waterfort gelegen en het zogenaamde fort aan de baai die ten zuiden van de Oranjebaai was gelegen, waarvan tegenwoordig nauwelijks nog iets van bekend is.

Ouidah aan de Slavenkust was een vestigingsplaats van Nederlanders, Fransen en Engelsen. De slavenhandel in deze plaats was voor het WIC-bestuur van zodanig belang geworden, dat de compagnie in 1703 besloot het hoofd van de nieuwe post tot 'oppercommies' te benoemen. Elders aan de Slavenkust hadden de hoofden van de factorijen de titel 'commies' of 'koopman'. In 1725 werd de factorij te Ouidah opgeheven. Dit had te maken met de politieke onrust aan de Slavenkust. De expansiedrift van de staat Dahomey, een in het binnenland van de Slavenkust gelegen rijk, veroorzaakte stagnatie in de slavenhandel. Na opheffing van het kantoor te Ouidah ging de slavenhandel van deze plaats over naar een meer oostelijk gelegen WIC-post in Jaquin, een zeer winstgevende post van de WIC.

Around 1627 the VOC built a wooden fort with two bastions in Ourien, which was situated on the west coast of the island of Ambon between the native village of Lima and Asiloeloe. For many years there were plans to reinforce the guard post or to replace it with a stone building, yet in 1662 these plans had still not yet been realised. The VOC forced the local population to supply drinking water to the Vlissingen redoubt on the neighbouring island of Nusatello.

On the south coast of Great Banda was the hamlet of Oerien, which was the station of the VOC chief of the eponymous post. The chief had a residence there. The 'perkeniers' who had a nutmeg garden within the territory of Oerien, were required to sell their produce to the chief residing here. Around 1629, the redoubt of Oerien was built to protect the area. The redoubt, which was also called Storm, had fallen into disuse around the middle of the 18th century.

From 1667 the Company had a gold and a silver mine in Salido. The VOC brought slaves from Madagascar to work in the mines. Because of the unhealthy conditions in the mines the mortality rate among miners was high. The gold and silver was shipped to the Dutch Republic in the form of ore, because it was too expensive to process the precious metal on the spot.

In 1619 the VOC opened a trading post in Palembang. Although it was closed a few years later by Jan Pieterszoon Coen, some contact was maintained with the town. The VOC's Resident in Jambi ordered pepper from the traders of Palembang, who sailed to Batavia themselves to sell the pepper. Because of the low profit yield for the Company, Batavia asked the sultan for permission to reopen the trading post in the town. The contract with the sultan gave the VOC Resident authority over all foreign ships calling at the harbour of Palembang. This enabled the Company to guard against illicit trading. Despite these privileges, the Company was still dependent on the sultan, who decided whether the Resident's demands were acceptable or not. In the 18th century Palembang supplied around 50,000 pounds of white pepper annually.

In de eerste helft van de 17de eeuw ondernamen de Fransen een poging tot kolonisatie van Suriname. Ze hadden zich tijdelijk gevestigd aan de monding van de rivier Suriname, waar ze een kleine redoute bouwden. Hier zou later (rond 1640) het Nederlandse fort Zeelandia komen te staan. Voor de komst van de Europeanen bestond de bevolking van Suriname uit indianen, waarvan de grootse groep de Arowak Indianen. Francis Willoughby, graaf van Parham en gouverneur van Barbados, arriveerde in 1650 en nam het land aan de Suriname rivier in bezit. Vanaf dat moment werd de streek een Engelse kolonie. Onder Engels bewind werd de belangrijkste stad van de kolonie Thorarica ofwel Sinto Bridges genoemd, deze plaats lag stroomopwaarts aan de rivier Suriname. Willoughbys plannen tot kolonisatie gingen ver. Hij bood gevluchte joden uit Cayenne en Brazilië nieuw land aan om zich er te vestigen en het land te verbouwen. Deze joden verlieten hun plantages in Brazilië toen de Nederlanders in 1654 door de Portugezen uit Brazilië werden verdreven. Zij besloten naar een rustiger en veiliger gebied te emigreren en kwamen zodoende in de Engelse kolonie aan de Suriname rivier terecht. Het gebied dat door Willoughby aan de joden werd verstrekt raakte later bekend met de naam 'de Jodensavanne'. In 1661 werd een oude Franse houten redoute, aan de monding van de rivier Suriname, versterkt en uitgebreid met een stenen fort. Dit fort kreeg de naam Willoughby.In 1667 wist de WIC-kamer Zeeland, dankzij Abraham Crijnssen en de Vrede van Breda, de kolonie Suriname in handen te krijgen. Door de nieuwe gezaghebber Crijnssen zou het fort Willoughby herdoopt worden in fort Zeelandia. Crijnssen versterkte het fort. Hij verbouwde het tot een groot vijfhoekig bastion. Rondom het fort breidde de stad Nieuw-Middelburg, later bekend als Paramaribo, zich uit tot de hoofdstad van de kolonie. Behalve fort Zeelandia werd er ook een nieuw fort aangelegd om Paramaribo en de plantages in het Surinaamse district beter te beschermen: in 1734 werd er aan de bouw van fort Nieuw-Amsterdam begonnen, tegenover fort Zeelandia op een modderbank genaamd Tijgerhol. De kosten van het behoud van de kolonie bleken te hoog voor de WIC. Zodoende besloot men Suriname aan een soort van consortium te verkopen. De stad Amsterdam en de heer Van Sommelsdijck, die later gouverneur werd van dit gebied, waren de nieuwe eigenaren. Het nieuwe bestuur kreeg de naam Sociëteit van Suriname. Fransen Hugenoten vluchtten naar het inmiddels Nederlands geworden Suriname en stichtten er plantages met Franse namen. In 1712 werd de welvarende kolonie door de Fransen aangevallen, echter zonder al te veel succes. Suriname groeide spoedig uit tot een welvarende en rijke kolonie met vele nieuwe plantages en mooie huizen. Paramaribo, of Nieuw-Middelburg, groeide mee. Al in 1718 schreef J.D. Herlein dat Paramaribo 500 houten huizen telde. Aan de waterkant waren Oranjebomen geplant. In de stad waren, als zetel van de kolonie, diverse gebouwen van de gouverneur en de commandant te vinden. Daarnaast waren er een kerk, een stadshuis en een synagoge. De joodse gemeenschap was vrij groot. De ervaring die de joodse plantersgemeenschap eerder had opgedaan in Brazilië, kwam in de kolonie Suriname goed van pas. Plantages lagen aan de oevers van belangrijke rivieren zoals de Suriname, de Commewijn en aan de kreken in de streek als de Para, Cottica, etc. In Paramaribo werd de eerste protestantse kerk in 1688 geopend. Een ziekenhuis volgde in 1695. In 1718 kwam de synagoge tot stand, in de tweede helft van de 18de eeuw opende de Lutherse kerk haar deuren en werd er gebouwd aan een kerkgebouw voor de evangelische broedergemeente. Toen in 1765 de Boni oorlogen uitbraken werd er besloten om het zogenaamde Cordonpad aan te leggen, een verdedigingslinie tegen de aanvallen van gevluchte slaven. Ook diende het Cordonpad om het weglopen van de slaven van de plantages te vermijden. Het Cordonpad bleek niet waterdicht; de slaven bleven vluchten. In 1795 ging Suriname over aan de Nederlandse staat, nadat de WIC failliet werd verklaard.

Priaman lay slightly to north of Padang on Sumatra's western coast. In 1671 the Company built a lodge in Priaman and later, around 1684, a fort. Priaman fell within the influence of the king of Atjeh, as did Padang and Indrapoura and a score of other VOC settlements on the West Coast of Sumatra. In 1663 the Company concluded a treaty with the king of Atjeh and after that the Company acquired a greater influence on the West Coast of Sumatra. However the trade with the outposts along the coasts remained sporadic due to the frequent clashes between the Sultan of Atjeh and other more minor local rulers. In addition the competition with other European trading companies, in particular that of the British, resulted in problems. Consequently the trading post at Priaman was sporadically abandoned, as was the case in 1698, only to be reinstated after a time. The Dutch finally left Priaman for good in 1770, along with the outpost at Ajerbangis.

The VOC maintained a small outpost in Parigi on the Tomini Gulf in northern Celebes.

De Braziliaanse kustplaats Paripueira, ofwel Aguas Mansas in de taal van de Indianen van dit gebied, lag ongeveer 30 kilometer ten noorden van Maceió, de hoofdstad van de staat Alagoas. Paripueira is gelegen aan een kleine rivier met dezelfde naam. Tijdens de strijd van de Nederlanders tegen de Portugezen in 1635 werden hier, op de weg van Porto Calvo naar Alagoa, twee kleine redoutes gebouwd onder bevel van kolonel van Schoppe. Hij liet deze versterkingen bouwen door de Poolse commandant Arciszewski. Eén van de redoutes stond op een heuvel, de andere lag aan het strand van Paripueira. Deze legerplaatsen waren bedoeld om de Portugese communicatie tussen Porto Calvo en Alagoa te verhinderen. De Nederlandse versterkingen moesten voorbereid zijn op een Portugese aanval op Porto Calvo.

It lost this position when Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen began concentrating the Company's trading activities in Batavia. Some time around 1622 the VOC abandoned its trading post in Pattani. Prior to that date its efforts to keep the local pepper trade out of the hands of the Chinese, its main competitors, had met with little success.

The main products to come out of Pekalongan were rice and sugar cane, although indigo was also grown there. The king paid for the production costs of the dyestuff himself, and sold it to the VOC at a fixed price per pound. In order to make sure of the Company's political support, the king also supported the cultivation of coffee, which the VOC introduced to Java in the 18th century. Within a few years the Company was able to start shipping cargoes of coffee to Europe.

Het kleine dorp Penedo, ofwel Openeda, aan de Rio São Francisco, werd in 1637 door de nieuwe gouverneur Johan Maurits van Nassau en zijn troepen definitief veroverd en bezet. Tijdens de inname sloeg het Portugese leger, onder leiding van de Napolitaanse graaf il Conte di Bagnoli, op de vlucht naar het zuiden, richting Bahia, het toenmalige hoofdkwartier van de Spaans-Portugese macht. De ligging van Penedo, ongeveer 30 kilometer stroomopwaarts de monding van de rivier, was zeer strategisch: vanuit deze plaats kon de zuidelijke grens van Nederlands-Brazilië goed beschermd worden. Daarom besloot Johan Maurits van Nassau er een groot fort te bouwen, fort Maurits ofwel forte Mauricio, op de hoogste punt van de rots (penedo in het Portugees) die over de rivier São Francisco uitkijkt. De rivier, als natuurlijke zuidelijke grens, bleef altijd moeilijk te verdedigen. Regelmatig waren er aanvallen van de Portugese-Braziliaanse guerrillatroepen. Het fort kwam in 1645 voor de duur van een jaar in het bezit van de Portugezen. In 1646 lukte het WIC-luitenant Henderson om Penedo wederom te veroveren, maar door schaarste aan voedsel en wapens duurde het niet lang eer Penedo weer in handen van de vijand zou vallen. Het fort werd naderhand verwoest. Nu doet alleen een naam aan het fort van Johan Maurits denken: Largo do forte, het belangrijkste plein van het stadje Penedo. De hele regio rond de monding van de Rio São Francisco en de tegenwoordige plaats Alagoas was van economisch belang voor de West-Indische Compagnie omdat het rijk aan vee was.

In 1604 VOC ships en route to China arrived at the Pescadores group of islands. However, the first attempts to trade with China from the largest island, Peng-Hu, came to nothing. It was not until 1622 that the VOC set foot on Peng-Hu once more, and at once began to build a fort. This occupation of Chinese territory resulted in a war with China which lasted two years. The VOC was forced to capitulate in 1624. The fort on Peng-Hu was destroyed, and a new fort was built on Taiwan.

The Perak area, situated between Melaka and Kedah, was known as a rich source of tin. As early as the 17th century the VOC attempted to gain a monopoly on the tin produced in Perak, but failed. In 1655 the VOC established a trading post in Perak. However the area was wracked by wars between the various local population groups. In the 18th century the sultan of Perak started to value the maintenance of good relations with the Dutch, because he feared the Boeginese. In 1746 the VOC signed a contract with the sultan. For the sultan this meant greater security, while for the VOC it helped them in the tin trade. The contract granted the VOC permission for the establishment of a trading post near Tanjung Putus, on the mouth of the Perak River. The Company built a small stone fort here and stationed a bookkeeper there. Tin was an important product for the inter-Asian market. The bulk was intended for the Chinese market, and little found its way to Holland.

Plymouth ligt aan de noordkust van het eiland Tobago. Toen de eerste Nederlandse kolonisten in 1628 op het eiland Tobago arriveerden, bouwden zij een fort aan de Grote Courland Bay, op een zeer steil klif. Deze eerste nederzetting werd Nieuw Vlissingen genoemd. Later, in 1654, toen zich een groep kolonisten onder leiding van de Hertog van Koerland hier aan de baai vestigde, herbouwden deze Koerlanders het fort. Zij herdoopten het met de naam fort Jacobus. De nederzetting zelf werd ook wel Jacobusstad genoemd. Het fort was groter dan voorheen en binnen de muren was plaats voor huizen, barakken en een kerk. Vijf jaar later, in 1659, lukte het de Nederlanders om de kolonie weer in handen te krijgen. Vanaf dat moment veranderde de naam van het fort in fort Beveren.

On the tiny island of Poelo Gontong, in east Sumatra, the Company set up a guard post even before the Siak area had been conquered. This military outpost soon acquired a reputation as an unhealthy place with a high percentage of fatalities. |Given its situation as a tiny island in the mouth of the Siak River, Poelo Gontong was a strategic location. The outpost enabled the VOC to control the trade flows to and from the interior. In 1765 the Supreme Government in Batavia decided to disband the settlement. The decision was influenced by the ongoing conflicts between the VOC and Rajah Mahmud of Siak. When the Rajah's men attacked Poelo Gontong in 1759 they killed a few score men.

Already in 1689, though, this pioneers' colony was prematurely abandoned after having been attacked and plundered by French privateers. - More than a century elapsed before plans for plantations on the banks of the Pomeroon were resumed. This followed the ending of the WIC in 1791 and the transfer of Essequibo and Demerara to the Council for the Colonies when, under the newly appointed governor, Willem August Sirtema, Baron van Grovestins (1791-1795), a period of economic recovery was initiated.

Ponerijn in northern Sri Lanka to the west of Elephant Pass was a strategic town for the VOC. For this reason the Company set up an outpost which was intended to guard the link between the coastal road between Mannar and Jaffnapattanam and the fort. Thanks to the redoubt at Ponerijn the VOC was able to combat the smuggling trade between the island and southern India, and also to monitor the sometimes rebellious Vanni tribes. According to the writer and traveller J. Haafner, who journeyed through the area on foot around 1800, the fort here had originally been built by the Portuguese and was captured by the Dutch.

Porto Calvo was een van de eerste Portugese nederzettingen in de tegenwoordige Braziliaanse staat Alagoas. Deze post was gelegen ten zuiden van Recife en Cabo de Santo Agostinho en ten noorden van Alagoa do Sul (nu Marechal Deodoro). Toen de Nederlanders in Porto Calvo in 1635 arriveerden, waren er zeven of acht engenhos, molens die suiker produceerden. De Portugezen hadden een jaar ervoor, in 1634, een groot fort gebouwd op een heuvel vlak bij het dorp, genaamd Povoacao, later Bom Sucesso ofwel Boaventura. Het fort werd in '35 veroverd en uitgebreid door de Nederlanders. In hetzelfde jaar nog zorgde de Portugees Mathias de Albuquerque ervoor dat het fort weer onder Portugees bestuur viel. Direct daarna werd een man met de naam Calabar, een mesties, gevangengenomen en terechtgesteld. Hij werd ervan beschuldigd zijn eigen volk te hebben verraden vanwege zijn vermeende hulp aan de Nederlanders.Het fort werd in 1637, met de komst van gouverneur Johan Maurits van Nassau, door de Nederlanders ingenomen en bleef onder controle van de West-Indische Compagnie tot 1645. In dat jaar heroverden de Portugezen Porto Calvo voor de tweede keer. Het fort werd verwoest en verlaten. Naast dit fort Bom Sucesso, was er volgens Nieuhoff een tweede fort in Porto Calvo, genaamd Igreja Nova ofwel Nieuwe Kerk, omdat het op de ruïnes van een kerk was gebouwd. Er is door de Nederlanders ook aan een derde fort gewerkt dat echter nooit voltooid werd. Niet ver van Porto Calvo ligt Uniao dos Palamares. Deze plaats raakte in de 17de eeuw bekend door de grote slavenopstand die hier en in het omringende gebied, dat nu Alagoas heet, uitbrak. Al vanaf het begin van de 17de eeuw ontstond in Uniao dos Palamares een van de grootste quilombos die er ooit in Brazilië hebben bestaan. Quilombos waren gemeenschappen gevormd door slaven die van de plantages langs de kust waren gevlucht en zich in het binnenland hadden verscholen. De reden dat Uniao dos Palamares tussen 1630 en 1654 uitgroeide tot een van de grootste quilombos had te maken met de oorlogen tussen de Portugezen en de Nederlanders die het hele gebied tot een grote chaos hadden gebracht. Na de Nederlandse capitulatie besloot de Portugese regering om het probleem van de gevluchte slaven definitief op te lossen. Dat was niet eenvoudig. Ondanks verschillende expedities die vanuit Recife, de hoofdstad van Pernambuco, werden gestuurd slaagde men er niet in Uniao dos Palmares te veroveren. Na 1670 werd de strijd van de slaven succesvol dankzij de charismatische persoonlijkheid van Zumbi, leider van de slavengemeenschap en van de oorlog tegen de Portugezen. In 1690 werden de Palmarinos, zoals deze slavengemeenschap genoemd werd, verslagen en Zumbi, hun leider, vermoord. Hiermee was de Portugese macht in Brazilië, na de herovering op de Nederlandse WIC van 1654, hersteld.

De post, die werd gebouwd met gebruik van materialen uit Nederland, was bedoeld voor 200 manschappen. Omdat deze nooit arriveerden werd het fort in 1635 al weer gesloopt. In plaats van dit fort kwam een nieuwe fortificatie: Wilschutsborg.

In the lands around Preanger, on the southern coast of West Java, coffee cultivation was introduced around 1700. The soil was exceptionally suitable for growing coffee due to the favourable situation in the hills in the interior, the benign climate and the protection afforded against the sea winds. As with most of the other products in which the VOC traded, the Company left the cultivation of the coffee to the local population. The Javanese rulers were required to ensure that their subjects grew coffee beans. The VOC monitored and controlled the cultivation of the beans and the quality of the crops by using self-appointed 'coffee sergeants'. In a series of treaties concluded with the sultanate of Mataram, agreements about the supply of products were made in 1705.

Het doel was om met deze vloot het eiland Principe, dat voor de kust van Gabon ligt, te veroveren en om er een verversingsstation op te richten voor de schepen op weg naar Indië. Dit lukte. Op 10 augustus 1598 werd het eiland zonder problemen veroverd. Maar de Nederlanders verbleven er niet lang: de eilandbewoners riepen hulp in van troepen van het eiland São Thomé om de Hollanders te verdrijven. Principe werd voor een tweede maal in 1641 door de Nederlanders bezet.

De Nederlandse handelspost die Arent Corssens in 1633 bouwde, was eerder een eenvoudig onderkomen dan een permanente post. Deze post lag aan een rivier die de Nederlanders Schuykill noemden. De post werd door de Zweden afgebroken en zij bouwden er een fort dat zij fort Nya Korsholm noemden. Echter in 1655 namen de Nederlanders het fort weer over. Tegenwoordig denkt men dat het fort ooit gelegen zou kunnen hebben op Province Island.

During the first decades of the 17th century the Dutch tried to create new possibilities for trade on the Coromandel Coast. The main reason was the tremendous demand for Pulicat textiles in the Moluccas. In 1610 Pulicat became the principal base on the Coromandel Coast, grouping a number of sub-trading stations. Together these trading stations formed a cartel, cutting out Portuguese competition and the local rulers. During the first half of the 17th century the VOC became increasingly involved in the endless civil wars surrounding the succession to the throne in this area. After some initial friction with the local authorities at Pulicat the Company gained permission to establish a fort. According to the treaty the local ruler would finance construction work and become part owner of the fort. However, work proceeded slowly and the VOC was forced to pay the costs itself. The town flourished under the Company's strict neutrality during wartime and under the protection the fort offered the population. The VOC's presence on the Coromandel Coast was primarily motivated by the many kinds of cotton fabric that were cheaply available. These textiles were highly prized in the Moluccas for the manufacture of garments and could be profitably exchanged there for spices. Pulicat was the most important centre of the textile trade on the coast. The VOC enjoyed various privileges in Pulicat, which enabled it to control textile production. The local manufacturers were only allowed to produce fabrics ordered by the Company. The VOC rapidly managed to acquire a trade monopoly in Pulicat. From 1610 Pulicat housed the VOC headquarters for the Coromandel Coast. In 1687 the governor relocated to Negapatnam. After the English captured Nagappattinam in 1781 the governors of Coromandel returned to Pulicat. In 1795 Pulicat fell to the English too.

Puloppalai was home to one of the VOC churches. Throughout the 17th century the Company was in a constant state of war with the king of Ceylon. Because of the proximity of the frontier with the king's territory the church was built more in the fashion of a fort. To the right was a building housing a school. Puloppalai provided wood for export. The compilers of this database have not as yet come across a source in the literature that identifies this location as a VOC post.

Vanaf het einde van de 16de eeuw voeren Nederlandse schepen naar de kust van het huidige Venezuela in Zuid-Amerika, op zoek naar zout. Zout was in die tijd een belangrijk product, zeker voor de Republiek, die haar welvaart voor een groot deel aan de haringvisserij had te danken. Toen Spanje in 1580, tijdens de tachtigjarige oorlog, Portugal bezette, werd het voor de Nederlandse kooplieden steeds moeilijker om aan de hoge kwaliteit zout uit de Portugese plaats Setubal te komen. De ontdekking van de zoutpannen van Punta de Araya, een schiereiland gelegen tussen de stad Cumana en het eiland Margarita in Zuid-Amerika, maakte het zeer voor de Nederlndse handelaars aantrekkelijk om daar zelf voet aan wal te gaan zetten. Voor de komst van de Nederlanders werd het schiereiland al door de Spanjaarden geëxploiteerd, meer voor de parels dan voor het zout. Het duurde niet lang eer de Nederlanders ook hier problemen met de Spanjaarden kregen. Zij bouwden daarom kleine tijdelijke veldschansen in de direkte omgeving. Na 1609 ving een korte periode van rust aan. Toen de Nederlanders, na het aflopen van het 12-jarig Bestand bij Punta de Arraya terugkwamen, waren de Spanjaarden al meester van het gebied dat zij nu beschermden met een grote vesting: Santiago de Arroyo.

Porca, slightly to the north of Kayankulam, fell under the aegis of the king of Cochin. The latter-day name of the village is Purakkad. Porca was originally a British trading post that was captured by the Dutch in 1666. The VOC finally succeeded in clinching a friendship treaty with the rajah of Porca in 1724. The Company subsequently built a stone lodge and a storage depot for pepper. Just as in Ponnani, the VOC appointed a resident here. The Dutch controlled the pepper monopoly from Porca to Cranganore.

Amangkurat I moved his new palace Purarya (Pleret) in 1647. In 1674 prince Trunanjaya revolted against Amangkurat I, who was forced to flee from his craton Pleret was ransacked The Sunan's two sons also joined their father. The second son, prince Puger, succeeded to regain Pleret. He crowned himself as King of Mataram. The result was a war with his elder brother Anom (Sunan Amangkurat II) in Kartasura, who with support of the VOC defeated Puger. Kartasura became the capital of the kingdom Mataram.

Puttalam was situated on the West Coast of Ceylon, north of Colombo. It became a well-known harbour town during the Portuguese era. When the Dutch came to Ceylon they sought permission to trade from the King of Kandy, who controlled the port. Puttalam functioned as an entropot for areca nut, a crop farmed by the King of Kandy's subjects. The wares were transported to the Indian coast via Kalpitiya. Puttalam was also a point of distribution for the Indian materials and textiles that were sold in Ceylon.

Van Goens finally succeeded in 1661: Quilon was conquered and the queen's palace was burned to the ground. After the VOC's capture of Quilon 480 soldiers were garrisoned there. One of their tasks was to act to the detriment of Portuguese possessions in Bombay. Quilon's played an important trade role as a supplier of pepper and pearls.

In de tijd dat Olinda de hoofdstad van Portugees Pernambuco was, was Recife een klein dorpje waar enkele vissers leefden en werkten. Het dorp lag op een smal schiereiland, gescheiden van Olinda door het water. Nadat de Nederlanders in 1630 Olinda op de Portugezen hadden veroverd, werd Recife vrij snel als centrum van Nederlands-Brazilië aangewezen door haar gunstige ligging. Het reeds aanwezige verdedigingsysteem kon makkelijk uitgebreid kon worden. Recife werd de hoofdstad en het handelscentrum van Nederlands-Brazilië, waar behalve de haven ook de administratieve en religieuze gebouwen van het koloniale bestuur gevestigd waren. In de omgeving werden verschillende nieuwe forten gebouwd en oude forten uit de Portugese tijd werden grondig versterkt of herbouwd. Bij de ingang van de haven bouwde men fort de Bruyne (Fort do Brum) en fort do Buraco. Andere forten waren fort St. George, het Waterkasteel en fort Waardenburgh, ook bekend als fort Driehoek, dat in 1630 gesticht werd. In 1639 waren er in Recife al 2000 huizen. Door de schaarste aan ruimte werden de huizen gebouwd zoals in Nederland, met twee of meer verdiepingen en hoge gevels. Tijdens het bewind van gouverneur Johan Maurits van Nassau werden er nieuwe regels toegepast om de woonomstandigheden in de stad te verbeteren. Toch was dit niet genoeg. De enige oplossing bleef de stichting van een nieuwe stad. Voor dit doel werd het nabijgelegen eiland Antonio Vaz gekozen. Wat is overgebleven van het oude Recife is nu te vinden in de centrale wijk (Recife Antigo) van de hoofdstad van de Braziliaanse staat Pernambuco. Er zijn nog enkele gebouwen uit de Nederlandse tijd zoals de oudste synagoge van Amerika, tegenwoordig een museum. In 1654, het jaar van de Nederlandse capitulatie, viel Recife samen met Mauritsstad in de handen van de Portugezen.

In 1680 the VOC set up a trading post in Rembang, primarily in order to buy up wood.

Rensselaerswijck was een kolonie gesticht door diamanthandelaar en bewindhebber van de WIC-kamer Amsterdam, Kiliaen van Rensselaer. Deze man, die het land kocht van de Mahican Indianen, is zelf nooit in Amerika geweest.. De kolonie, in dit geval een patroonschap, werd rond 1638 gesticht iets ten oosten van fort Oranje aan de Hudson rivier. Rensselaerswijck was al in 1660 uitgegroeid tot een welvarend dorp. Er woonden zo'n 200 mensen. Dergelijke patroonschappen werden door de WIC verleend aan eigenaren van land, vergelijkbaar met plantagehouders. (Met het verschil dat een plantage meestal uit één hoofdhuishouden bestaat en een patroonschap uit veel meer huishoudens.)Peter Stuyvesant had moeite met deze zelfstandige kolonie. Na enig geharrewar over de plaatselijke autoriteit, claimde hij een door de kolonie gebouwd dorpje in de directe omgeving van fort Oranje als officieel WIC-territorium en noemde dat Beverwijck (nu Albany).

Aan de Braziliaanse rivier Rio Formoso, ten zuiden van Cabo de Santo Agostinho, werd in 1633 door de Nederlanders een fort gebouwd, waarschijnlijk droeg het de naam fort Oranje. De Nederlanders hadden tussen 1632 en 1631 geprobeerd deze streek onder controle te krijgen, echter zonder succes. In 1633 lukte het de WIC om een Portugese versterking in te nemen en zich daar te vestigen om de toegang tot het gebied Arraial de Bom Jesus, waar het hoofdkwartier van de Portugese guerrilla gevestigd was, af te snijden. Zo werd het binnendringen in de vlakte van Varzea vergemakkelijkt. De Varzea was het meeste rijke gebied van de hele capitania (provincie) van Pernambuco.

Robben Island also served to shelter from the wind those vessels lying at anchor in Table Bay. In the months of April to October, when the wind blew from the north-west, the area became extremely hazardous for shipping.

Around 1634 the nutmeg trees on Rozengian were cut and the inhabitants were forced to move to one of the other Banda Islands. Until well into the 19th century, the island was used as a destination for convicted criminals, who were deported to the islands and forced to work in chain gangs in the djati forests as lumberjacks, or in the lime kilns or brickyards. For good reason Rozengain was also called 'Bandit Island.'

Run was one of the five Bandanese nutmeg islands. In 1616 it became an English colony. In 1621, the VOC took possession of Run without English permission. Around 1627, the VOC decided to concentrate the cultivation of nutmeg on the islands of Banda Lontar, Ai and Banda Neira. Run was rendered uninhabitable and all the mutmeg trees were cut down. De population was forced to leave. From 1629 the island was virtually uninhabited. In 1654 England and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Amboyna, in which it was arranged that the VOC should cede the island back to the English. The acutal transfer took place in 1665. Because of the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Run was retaken by the VOC in that same year. In the Peace of Breda in 1667 Run, along with Surinam, was ceded to the Dutch, in exchange for, among others, New Amsterdam, which is present-day New York.

On the Taiwanese mainland, across from the sandbank where the VOC built fort Zeelandia in 1624, a Chinese-Dutch settlement soon developed. Its name, Saccam, probably derives from the language of the Siraya, the aboriginal group inhabiting this area. When the Chinese under VOC rule revolted in 1652, Saccam was partly destroyed in the revolt. For this reason Fort Provintia was built in the settlement in 1653. - When the Chinese warlord Koxinga invaded Taiwan in late April 1661, Saccam was the first settlement he conquered. After he succeeded in driving the VOC off Taiwan, Saccam would become the capital of the Tungning kingdom founded by him.

In 1652 the political Council of the Cape decided to commission an investigation of the area comprising St. Helena Bay, Saldanha Bay and nearby rivers and islands. The Company wanted to see whether the regions could be profitably exploited. If possible the Company wanted to engage in barter with the Koina tribe. Because the entire western coast north of the Cape fell outside the Company's charter, it could be claimed by the WIC or by other European powers. Eventually the Company founded a post at Saldanha Bay to repair VOC vessels and to avert a possible enemy threat. Thanks to the situation of its bay, Saldanha was a good anchorage for the Company's vessels. The post also played a key role in the supply of refreshments for VOC ships en route to the east. It supplied the vessels with fish, meat and vegetables. Until 1700 this outpost represented the northernmost borderpoint of the Cape colony. After 1795 it fell under the control of the British.

De WIC richtte al snel na het oprichtingsjaar 1621 haar krachten op de Portugese kolonie Brazilië en in het bijzonder op de stad Bahia, het centrum van deze kolonie. De Portugezen maakten enige tijd veel winst dankzij de productie van suiker. Deze winsten waren mogelijk door hun monopolie op de slavenhandel. Slaven waren immers de werkkrachten van de grote suikerplantages. Een eerste WIC-aanval op Bahia werd in 1624 gepleegd. Maar na een kortdurend succes werden de Nederlanders al weer na een jaar door de Spaans-Portugese macht uit Bahia verdreven. De WIC besloot niet direct op te geven. Na Piet Heins verovering van 'de Zilvervloot' vond een tweede aanval op Brazilië plaats. In 1630 werd het duidelijk dat de beste kansen voor succes niet in en om Bahia zouden liggen, maar bij het centrum van de suikerproductie, de regio Pernambuco in het noordoosten van de kolonie. Toch werd er in 1638, onder leiding van de nieuwe gouverneur Johan Maurits, opnieuw richting Bahia gemarcheerd. De meeste Portugezen waren na de veroveringstochten van Maurits hier naar toe gevlucht. Hun verzet tegen de WIC werd vanuit Bahia georganiseerd. Hoewel de forten buiten de stad in Nederlandse handen vielen (zoals de forten St. Alberto, S. Filipe en S.Bartolomeu), lukte het Johan Maurits niet om de stad Bahia te bezetten, de troepen trokken zich terug. Vanaf dit moment werden er nog verschillende pogingen gedaan, maar Bahia bleef onder Portugese controle. In 1646 werd het eiland Itaparica in de Bahia de Todos os Santos (Allerheiligenbaai) veroverd met de bedoeling de Portugese scheepvaart vanuit Salvador te belemmeren. Het was geen succes en een jaar later werd het eiland definitief ontruimd.

Het eiland Puertorico vormde voor de Spanjaarden een steunpunt voor hun handel en vaart in het Caribisch gebied. Sinds de 16de eeuw hadden zij zich op het eiland gevestigd met als hoofdkwartier de nederzetting San Juan. Om de baai van San Juan te verdedigen hadden de Spanjaarden verschillende forten gebouwd, waarvan het grootste fort San Felipe del Morro was. Sinds de oprichting van deze versterking toonde de WIC interesse om zich meester van het eiland Puertorico te maken. Dit is nooit echt gelukt. Alleen in 1625 lukte het de Nederlander Hendricksz. om het fortje Canuela te veroveren, maar niet het grootste fort, S. Felipe del Morro, dat daar tegenover lag. Het beleg duurde niet lang. In november moest Hendricksz. de strijd opgeven. Na deze mislukte poging werden de forten en de stad van San Juan door de Spanjaarden versterkt om zich tegen de komende aanvallen beter te kunnen verdedigen.

In het zuiden van het Portugees-Braziliaanse gewest Pernambuco, de streek waar twee grote lagunes (as lagoas ofwel Alagoas) lagen, waren twee dorpen in Portugees bezit. Het ene dorp, aan de noordelijke lagune, was Alagoa do Norte, het andere dorp lag aan de zuidelijke lagune en droeg de naam Alagoa do Sul. De twee dorpen waren strategisch gelegen op de kustroute tussen Recife en de zuidelijke grens, de rivier São Francisco. In Alagoa do Norte stonden slechts drie engenhos (suikermolens), de regio was vooral van belang voor de WIC vanwege de aanvoer van vee en mandioca (maniok), een radijssoort waarvan meel gemaakt werd. Dit meel is nog steeds het basisingrediënt van het dagelijkse voedsel in Brazilië. Toen de Nederlanders in 1633 in Alagoas kwamen, vielen zij Alagoa do Norte binnen. Tegen alle verwachtingen in verzette de bevolking van de nederzetting zich hardnekkig tegen de nieuwkomers. In 1637, het jaar waarin het hele zuidelijke gebied van Pernambuco (tegenwoordig de staat Alagoas) door Johan Maurits van Nassau onder controle van de WIC gebracht werd, kwam ook Alagoa in Nederlandse handen.

Na de verovering van Loanda en het eiland São Tomé in Afrika, besloot Johan Maurits van Nassau, gouverneur van Nederlands-Brazilië, het Portugese eiland Maranhao in het noorden van Brazilië aan te vallen. Volgens Barlaeus, die tussen 1654 en 1664 Nederlands-Brazilië beschreef, waren er toen de Nederlanders voet aan wal zetten slechts zes bruikbare engenhos en drie indianendorpen. Engenho is de Portugese naam voor de molens waar suikerriet (cana de acucar) tot suiker werd verwerkt. Op het eiland lag ook een fort, genaamd São Luis do Maranhao. Honderden slaven die uit Afrika waren gehaald, werkten dag en nacht op deze suikermolens. Het suikerriet werd massaal op de grote plantages in Zuid-Amerika en op de Antillen verbouwd. Het eiland Maranhao bleef drie jaar lang onder Nederlands bestuur, in 1644 werd het opnieuw veroverd door de Portugezen. Maranhao was het laatste gewest in Brazilië dat onder Nederlands gezag raakte. Tussen 1641 en 1644 bereikte het Nederlands Braziliaanse territorium zijn maximale omvang: het strekte zich uit van Maranhao in het noorden tot Sergipe del Rey in het zuiden.

Saway, situated on the bay of the same name on Ceram's northern coast, was the first Dutch settlement to be established on this coast. Establishing a presence in the north and east of Ceram was less important to the Company than acquiring a foothold on the other islands which made up Ambon (the central and southern Moluccas). The outpost at Saway comprised a simple building surrounded by a stockade, a wooden perimeter fence. By 1788 or thereabouts the Company had fortified this settlement, which also boasted a stone powder magazine, with an additional 44 men.

In 1654 vestigde zich een groep Koerlanders, genoemd naar hun aanvoerder de hertog van Koerland op Tobago. In datzelfde jaar stichtte de WIC een nieuwe kolonie aan de andere kant van het eiland, aan de Lampsinsbaai, ofwel Rockly Bay. Op een hoge heuvel bouwden de Nederlandse kolonisten het fort Lampsinsberg. Het fort had vier bastions, enkele barakken, een arsenaal en een gouverneurshuis. Onder aan de heuvel lag Lampsinstad. Naast het fort Lampsingsberg werd al snel door de Nederlanders een tweede, wat kleiner fort gebouwd, 'het fort van de Lampsins'. Het lag aan de zuidkant van het eiland maar de exacte locatie is niet duidelijk. Later, tijdens de expeditie van de Nederlander Jacob Binckes in 1676, werden er nieuwe forten op Tobago opgericht. De bedoeling van deze nieuwe expeditie was het eiland als handelscentrum te versterken en te koloniseren. Een nieuw fort, Sterreschans, werd gebouwd. Daarnaast, recht voor het fort op de heuvel, plaatste men nog een kleiner bolwerk met zicht op de baai. Het nieuwe fort Sterreschans was gelegen aan de Klipbaai, ofwel Rockly Bay, nabij het oude fort van Lampsins. Het was bemand met 480 mensen en had 23 kannonen. In 1677, toen de Fransen het eiland definitief veroverden, werd Sterreschans opgeblazen. Bickens en 250 van zijn mannen kwamen om het leven.

The VOC outpost of Rietveld was also known as Zeekoe Valleij. It lay east of Sandvlei, on the False Bay coast. The outpost mainly offered work to farm labourers. In 1751 they were given an additional task: to report those people carrying weapons. This was because the wild animals on the Cape Flats needed to be protected. Slaves with weapons had to be imprisoned, for otherwise they could learn to become self-supporting by hunting.

Na een aantal jaar van Nederlandse aanwezigheid, bouwden de Nederlanders in het plaatsje Sacunde hun fort Oranje. De WIC vestigde zich rond 1670 in het 'goudgebied'. In 1694 vielen de plaatselijke Ahanti het fort aan. Zij namen het fort in en vernietigden het zodanig dat het door de Nederlanders opnieuw opgebouwd moest worden. Met de economische situatie van de WIC was het in Sacunde niet verbijsterend goed gesteld. Rapporten tonen aan dat tussen 1705 en 1716 weinig goud werd geëxporteerd en dat slechts 151 slaven werden verhandeld. In 1872 ging het fort over naar de Engelsen.

In Semarang the Company encouraged the cultivation of indigo, which was used as a dyestuff. The local ruler declared his willingness to invest in indigo production, and soon delivered the first shipments. Growers continued to produce indigo, even when the price fell drastically as a result of oversupply. - In 1708 the headquarters of the VOC on the north-eastern coast of Java was relocated to Semarang from Japara. In 1748 the 'opperhoofd' or supervisor in Semarang was named governor of the north-east coast of Java. - The city was divided into four parts: the Javanese settlement with the big mosque, markets and the house of the regent on the west bank of Kali Semarang, the Malay settlement on the east bank, the Chinese settlement opposite the Javanese settlement on the east bank and the Dutch settlement with the fort north of the Chinese settlement.

In de aan de Goudkust gelegen plaats Senya Beraku werd in 1667 een loge gebouwd door de Nederlandse WIC-dienaren. Daarmee startte een langdurige relatie met de bewoners van het gebied Agona. In 1705 werd begonnen met de bouw van een fort. Door de hoop op een bloeiende handel in goud, ivoor en slaven gaven de Nederlanders het fort de naam 'De Goede Hoop'. De naam werd bewaarheid: de handel in slaven werd zeer omvangrijk door de talloze oorlogen in de regio. Deze conflicten leverden zoveel slaven op, dat het fort te klein bleek voor de verwerking ervan. In 1816 werd het fort verlaten.

During this expedition, the population of Seram Laut surrendered, in spite of their fortifications which the attacking VOC forces found daunting, and declared themselves to be vassals of the VOC. Even so, conflict between the inhabitants of Seram Laut and the VOC would recur throughout subsequent decades.

The village of Serikkembelo, once known as Cambello, had long been subject to the king of Ternate, who was in a state of war with the Spanish. In 1607 Admiral Matelieff agreed with this king that the VOC would protect him against the Spanish, in exchange for cloves from all the Molucca Islands. Cambello was one of the first locations at which the VOC was permitted to build a trading post and a fort, under the terms of a contract with the local ruler. Cambello was one of the most important sources of cloves.

Sirkhej, or Sergees, now known as Sharkej, was a small town near Ahmadabad which was reputed to supply the best indigo in all India. The VOC opened a trading post there in the 17th century, which closed in 1670. Like many Indian cities, Sirkhej had a 'tang' or tank, which functioned primarily as a reservoir for the town's drinking water. In addition gardens were often laid out around these tangs, which served as the burial ground for leading citizens of the town. The tombs often took the shape of little round buildings.

In addition there was a powder room, lodgings for the military, a hospital and a church. The town was situated at the point where two rivers met; these were the Tsitaron, also known as the Beet River, and Tsikouw. The town was most likely also known as Tjikao at a later date.

St. Kitts was settled by English and French colonist in the years after 1623. Both groups settled at the two opposite extremes of the island. Hessel Gerritsz mentions in his Rotario that settlements could be found on three different sides of the island. On the southeast side, the French cultivated tabacco and held a fort, as they did on the west too. Two miles north of this site layed an English fort next to a river which offered good drinking water. The French were forced to dig holes to find proper water sources. The colonist, among whom several Dutchmen, focusses on the cultivation of tobacco, which made them dependent on importing food from other colonies. Dutch merchants on Sint-Eustatius saw their chances and traded food for salt.

In the late 1550s, the French pirate François le Clerc (known as Jambe de Bois, due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on Pigeon Island, from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the Oliphe Blossome was blown off-course on its way to Guyana, and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605, only 19 survived, after continued attack by the Carib chief Augraumart, so they fled the island. In 1664, Thomas Warner (son of Sir Thomas Warner, the governor of St Kitts) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the French West India Company resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique. Both the British and the French found the island attractive after the sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century. In 1722, George I of Great Britain granted both Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent to The 2nd Duke of Montagu. He in turn appointed Nathaniel Uring, a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.

The refreshment station at Table Bay was never intended as a profit-making venture for the VOC. The Cape could only become self-supporting with the aid of a large population of white farmers. Until the late 17th century the European population was confined to the area between Cape Town and the first mountain ranges of the south-western Cape, an area of roughly 70 by 100 kilometres. In 1672 a large area of land was purchased from the Hottentots (the indigenous Khoi-khoi and San) and settlers began expanding beyond the Cape plain. In 1679, Stellenbosch was founded under the administration of Governor Simon van der Stel. The governor opened his own businesses in the town. After 1700 the colony's farming activities expanded even further east, and Stellenbosch became the name of a district.

Keraton (Palace) Kasunanan is also called Surakarta Hadiningrat Palace was built in 1745 by Sultan Paku Buwono II. It started with the construction of Mataram Palace to replace the palace at Kartasura which was destroyed in the 1742's rebellion of the Chinese people against the power of Pakubuwono II, ruler at Kartasura. With the assistance of VOC the rebellion was squashed. Kartasura was retaken, but the palace was already destroyed and considered desecrated. Pakubuwono II then ordered Tumenggung (Minister) Honggowongso and Tumenggung Mangkuyudo and the Dutch commander J.A.B. van Hohendorff to find a location for the new capital of Mataram Kingdom. A new palace was then built on a site, 20 km South East of Kartasura, in 1745, at Sala Village, on the banks of the River Bengawan Solo. It was later renamed, Surakarta. (Old manuscripts mentioned, “Salakarta”). According to archives, the new palace was built using teak wood from Kethu Forest, a forest near Wonogiri city, and the logs were drifted to the site through the river. The new palace was officially taken in use on February 17, 1745.

After various unsuccessful attempts, the VOC opened a base in Surat in 1616. Surat was the main port of northern India, and belonged to the Great Mogul Empire. The merchants of Surat sailed to Persia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Initially the VOC purchased cotton fabrics from the Surat merchants who traded them in Atjeh. The fabrics were an indispensable means of exchange in the Moluccan spice trade. During the course of the 17th century the Company succeeded in capturing the bulk of the trade in cotton and spices between Surat and the archipelago. The VOC had no forts and relatively few employees in Surat. Compared with its other bases, the Company's military presence here was minimal. In the early 18th century the Mogul Empire began to decline. This led to unrest in the interior, and supplies of cotton and indigo to Surat dwindled. Trade with Persia also diminished as a result of political unrest. During the 18th century, Surat's role was taken over completely by Bombay, where the British maintained a trading base. The VOC carried on a flourishing trade at Surat. The Company had been granted a number of trading privileges by the Mogul emperor and the Surat directorate established other trading bases in centres as far away as Agra. Once the VOC started trading cotton and spices in the Red Sea region and opening trading bases there, many Surat merchants feared that they would lose out to the Company there too. But although there was a decline in the overland caravan trade through Persia as a result of the VOC's shipments of cotton and spices to Europe, the Company was never able to dominate the trade in the Red Sea region completely. The Company's directors and merchants in Surat lived in fabulous style. Their public appearances were as impressive as those of the local nobility or courtiers at India's imperial palace. For example, they would travel in canopied palanquins, accompanied by a complete retinue. It was often a source of considerable annoyance to Company officials in Batavia, but the Surat office maintained that it was essential to make a display of power and wealth in order to achieve anything in India. The VOC opened a base at Surat in 1616. The first director took up his post there in 1620. Surat was in English hands between 1781 and 1784. The VOC subsequently regained control only to lose it once more to the English in 1795.

The VOC maintained several comptoirs in the kingdom of Pegu, including that of Siriangh. An office was set up here in 1635. Together with Martavaan, Siriangh was easy to access by water, unlike the other two comptoirs, Ava and Pegu, which were located in the interior. In 1679 the Company decided to disband the offices in Siriangh and Ava due to their 'improper actions and poor negotiation': 'hare onbehoorlyke maniere van doen en de slegte negotie'.

De Engelsen zouden hier tijdig mee zijn opgehouden, vanwege de tegenvallende aanwezigheid van de grondstof. Toch bouwden de Nederlanders er in 1665 fort Witsen. Dit fort wordt echter na een paar jaar verwoest. In 1684 wordt fort Witsen verlaten.

Riouw, today known as Tanjungpinang, was a major port in the Malacca Straits. From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the VOC made several attempts to gain control of the harbour at Riouw, where the private trade in tin was concentrated. Riouw was known as a staple market, where people made their living from free trade. During the VOC era, the town fell under the authority of the Sultan of Jahore. The Company wished to subject this port to its rule, but the sultan was able to prevent this. It was only in the late 18th century, around 1784, that the VOC appointed a resident to gather the tolls. However the free trade in tin, which the VOC regarded as illicit trade, continued.

Terlucco was a VOC outpost on the east coast of the island of Ternate, just north of Malayo. In 1610 the VOC built a fort here known as Tolucco or Hollandia in a bid to prevent the Spanish from establishing a settlement here and thereby making the harbour unsafe. The fort was built of stone and slaked lime, and had an unusual layout that differed entirely from that of other fortifications built by the Dutch. It could be that the unusual construction was linked to the fort's location on the very point of a cliff.

Fort Oranje was built by the VOC in 1607 in Malayo on Ternate. It was a strong fortress surrounded by a moat. Various other forts were later built on Ternate, or captured from the Spanish. The VOC's military power on Ternate was mainly intended to fight the smugglers who traded with their competitors, and to maintain the clove monopoly. In 1801 Fort Oranje fell to the English. The clove-producing North Molucca Islands were divided into a number of small states, the most powerful of which was the sultanate of Ternate. The earliest contacts between the Dutch and Ternate date back as far as 1599. In 1607 the sultan of Ternate asked the VOC to provide it with assistance against an attack by the Spanish. Although it proved impossible to drive the Spaniards off the island completely, the Company did obtain an agreement granting a monopoly of the clove trade. Ternate was dependent on foreign traders to sell its cloves and import foodstuffs. The ships used in the area, known as cora-coras, were used for warfare, and were not suitable for trading transport. The VOC's trade monopoly in Ternate also made the island dependent on the Company for food imports. But because the VOC imports were insufficient to meet the demand, the inhabitants of Ternate were continually forced to violate the monopoly. The VOC did all it could to stamp out the smuggling, and often used violence. The trade agreements with the sultan were ceremonially reaffirmed regularly after they had been broken. Each time the sultan had to promise not to supply cloves to anyone other than the Company. The food shortages that plagued the population because of the Company monopoly led to revolts, which the VOC crushed with much bloodshed. In 1677 the sultan of Ternate was finally stripped of all his military power and made permanently subject to the VOC. Prior to the foundation of Batavia in 1619, the VOC's governor-generals were more or less peripatetic; taking up residence alternately on Ambon and in Fort Oranje on Ternate. After 1619 the governor of the Molucca Islands resided for a time in the fort on Ternate.

In 1605 the VOC conquered the island of Tidore. The Portuguese had a number of bases on the island; after their defeat by the VOC, they left the Molucca islands for good. The subjection of the sultan of Tidore, who had long been the major competitor and enemy of the sultan of Ternate, was of strategic importance to the VOC. It enabled the Company to secure a trade monopoly in the Molucca islands. As well as food crops, Tidore also produced cloves. After the VOC's conquest of the Portuguese territories, the sultan of Tidore appealed to the Spanish in Manila for assistance. The Spanish who succeeded in establishing a foothold on Tidore remained on the island until 1663. Only after their departure was the VOC able to gain complete control over the trade there. The Company's presence on Tidore was always limited to small military posts; the island lacked a good harbour, and so a trading station was never opened there.

The deep bay of Trincomalee was an ideal natural harbour and shelter for ships. In 1639 the VOC captured Trincomalee from the Portuguese. The port was strategically important as a base for the fleet and guarding the sea routes. In the 17th century the port was guarded by as many as six forts. Even so, this proved insufficient to repel the French, who attacked in 1672. The port was soon recaptured. Because of its unhealthy climate, Trincomalee was unpopular among Company employees. Ceylon's main product was cinnamon, and small amounts were also harvested at Trincomalee. To harvest the cinnamon, the bark is cut from the tree. It is then dried in the sun and rolled up. The area around Trincomalee also supplied clothes, pearls, wood, and the stimulant areca. During the 17th century the East Indies Council in Batavia debated several times whether to hand Trincomalee over to the king of Kandy. Rijcklof van Goens, governor of Ceylon, opposed this vigorously. He preferred to fortify the harbour, and it was he who increased the number of forts to six. When English competition in the region increased in the late 18th century, the forts were further strengthened. Because of its strategic importance the harbour was a constant centre of political discord.

The islands were first recorded as sighted in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha; rough seas prevented a landing. He named the main island after himself, Ilha de Tristão da Cunha. It was later anglicised from its earliest mention on British Admiralty charts, to Tristan da Cunha Island. Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520, when the Lás Rafael captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called at Tristan for water. The first undisputed landing was made on 7 February 1643 by the crew of the Dutch East India Company ship Heemstede, captained by Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot. The Dutch stopped at the island four more times in the next 25 years, and in 1656 created the first rough charts of the archipelago.The first full survey of the archipelago was made by crew of the French corvette Heure du Berger in 1767. The first scientific exploration was conducted by French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, who stayed on the island for three days in January 1793, during a French mercantile expedition from Brest, France to Mauritius. Aubert made botanical collections and reported traces of human habitation, including fireplaces and overgrown gardens, probably left by Dutch explorers in the 17th century.

During the 17th century the VOC maintained a trading post in the affluent city of Baroda, which was situated north of Surat in the interior, on the route between Broach and Ahmedabad. Baroda was particularly well known for its coarsely woven cottons, that were exported via Cambay by Portuguese, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu merchants. In the surrounding region the people grew indigo. The pigment was not of a particularly good quality and for this reason served as a dyestuff for cheaper types of textiles.

De verovering van Brazilië had de Heren XIX doen hopen dat er ook andere streken van Zuid-Amerika onder Nederlandse invloed konden worden onderworpen. De West-Indische Compagnie hoopte met de expeditie naar Chili zelf aan het goud en zilver te kunnen komen dat voorheen alsmaar in Spaanse handen was. De expeditie, onder leiding van Brouwer en Herckmans, vertrok in 1642 vanuit Nederland. Via Recife, de hoofdplaats van Nederlands-Brazilië, werd naar Chili gereisd. De expeditie werd geen succes. Het lukte de WIC niet om zich er langer dan een paar maanden te vestigen. Het eerste doel was het eiland Chiloe, een strategisch punt van waaruit de Zuid-Amerikaanse kust aangevallen kon worden. Vanuit dit eiland deden de Nederlanders in 1643 de haven van Valdivia aan. Valdivia was ooit een van de machtscentra van de Spanjaarden en werd in 1599 verwoest en heroverd door de Chilenen. De Nederlanders kregen van de Chileense bevolking toestemming om op het plein van Valdivia een schans te bouwen. De Nederlanders, op zoek naar goud, werden door de inwoners van Valdivia ontmoedigd dit metaal te zullen vinden. Na een jaar werd Valdivia verlaten omdat de Spaanse vloot vanuit de hoofdstad Lima op weg was en de gevraagde Nederlandse versterkingen vanuit Brazilië niet op tijd in Valdivia aankwamen. Herckmans keerde met zijn mannen terug naar Brazilië, Brouwer was al eerder op het eiland Chiloe overleden.

Waisama is situated on Buru, a big island at the far west side of the Ambon Islands. In the first half of the 17th century, it was officially under indirect rule from the Sultan of Ternate. As opposed to Western Seram, the VOC did not have much involvement in the region in this period. However, as the island was sometimes used as a hiding place and staging area by opponents of the VOC monopoly from e.g. Makassar, when they came to fight and/or trade in the islands, the VOC sometimes sent expeditions there to find and destroy such fleets. In 1657 the VOC officially became the ruler of Waisama, along with all of Buru, when the indirect rule of Ternate was abolished. Even after that time, however, the VOC had limited power and influence there.

In that year the outpost on Aroe, then named Wokan, was manned by 11 VOC employees. The island was famous for its oyster banks. A report about the post written by the 2 VOC officials Cornelis Stul and Carel Roosenburgh, who visited the island in 1683, paints a bleak picture of the situation at the time. They found a nurse and two soldiers seriously ill and a half-blind sergeant. The schoolmaster who had been appointed to bring Christianity to the indigenous population was absent, having undertaken a journey in order to promote his private trading interests. The governor further learned that two other VOC employees had been murdered, while a third had died not long before his visit.

Toen hij een patroonschap (zoals Rensselaerswijck) voor zichzelf wilde, verkreeg hij van de West-Indische Compagnie een stuk land, dat hij Colen Donck noemde. Het lag ietsje ten noorden van Manhattan. Patroonschappen werden door de WIC verleend aan een soort van plantagehouders, met het verschil dat een plantage meestal uit één hoofdhuishouden bestaat en een patroonschap uit veel meer huishoudens.Van der Donck stelde zich Nieuw-Nederland voor als een voortvarend gebied vol met bruisende steden. Dankzij zijn inspanningen verkreeg Nieuw-Amsterdam in 1653 stadsrechten. Daarnaast schreef Van der Donck een uitgebreid werk over Nieuw-Nederland.

After the VOC had settled on Taiwan in 1624, hoping to be able to set up regular trade with China from there, they were regularly active in the area around Xiamen. This area was the power base of the Zheng clan, a mighty maritime faction with much influence on the China Sea and along the coast, with which the VOC had a rather tenuous relationship. In the 1630s, the VOC fought several battles near the islands, sometimes as an ally of clan leader Zheng Zhilong, sometimes as his enemy. - After the fall of the Ming Dynasty (1644) Zhilong's son, Zheng Chenggong (known in the Dutch sources as Koxinga) became the dominant power in the region. From the nearby island of Jinmen (known in Dutch sources as Quemoy), he launched an invasion of Taiwan in 1661, which would drive the Dutch from the region. - The river which floats out onto the ocean just west of Xiamen, the Jiulong, was known to the Dutch as the Chincheo. - Nowadays, Xiamen is Chinese territory, whereas Jinmen is Taiwanese.
